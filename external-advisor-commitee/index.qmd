# Main Goal {.smaller}

üéØ The main goal is to **reinforce the applied research and technological transfer capacities of the universities** improving their services portfolios to strengthen the plastic industry's contribution to the green transition.

The ambition is to foster the collaboration and partnerships of the University with socio-economic stakeholders to incubate, establish and develop circular initiatives, demonstrating operational success by carrying out joint recycling interventions integrating actors in the plastics value chain in Colombia, Argentina, and Chile.

**Specific Goals**

- SO1: To identify and understand key barriers and leverage points of the local plastic companies to generate university-industry collaboration opportunities.

- SO2: Create and implement services and solutions portfolios for the plastics value chain based on the university's core competencies and knowledge. 

- SO3: Encourage multi-actor initiatives to enhance the reuse of plastic involving waste pickers organizations, companies and the local public sectors, taking advantage of the University's articulation capacities. 

- SO4: Develop recommendations on new technologies, business models, and organizational setups for university-industry collaborations based on the lessons learned from the implemented projects as a tool to improve, scale up and transfer good practices in HEIs in Latin America.
