Particular focus will be placed on:\n\nTechnological transfer and academia-industry collaboration : experts in these competences will TechTraPlastiCE consortium to adquire effective knowledge onthe different transfer mechanisms and partnerships and their limitations. This is important in the sscope of the project.\nCircular economy within the plastic value chain: experts in cricular economy could bring to the consortium examples of sustainable practices, lifecycle thinking, and resource efficiency where the academia can collaborate with the socio-economical actors.\nIntegration of marginalized actors in the plastic value chain into academic and research ecosystems : experts in this topic can illustrated the consortium, and more particular the latinamerican context, the relevant role of inclusivity, equity, and capacity building for underrepresented communities in the circular economy. This is a major competence where the shared of experiences will have a major impact inside and outside of the consortium."
