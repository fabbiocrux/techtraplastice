    "text": "With the support of Université de Lorraine (UL) as TechTraPlastiCE Project Coordinator and the participation and colaboration of all partners, Universidad Nacional de Río Negro (UNRN) will lead Work Package 5 (WP5) - Dissemination and Communication.\nThis work package is supporting the TechTraPlastiCE Project throughout the whole implementation process and aims at a widespread impact. Therefore, WP5 leader, fully supported by all other partners of the project, will execute the five work areas (tasks) that involves this WP:\n\nDocument with the digital strategy (D5.1.)\nBranding digital material and training program (D5.2)\nWebsite and Social Media accounts (D5.3)\nOpen Digital Repository (D5.4)\nFinal conference document results (D5.5)\n\nIn this document, we will address the Dissemination and Exploitation strategy of the TechTraPlastiCE Project (D.5.1), which aims to guarantee the high multiplier effect, disseminate the results of the project at institutional, local, national and international level, and ensure the visibility of EU funding. In addition, the dissemination of activities are an integral part of the project and will be carried out from the beginning of it, both internally (at the level of the institutions involved) as well as externally (locally, regionally, nationally and internationally). Hence, the purpose of this Dissemination and Exploitation Plan is to define internal and external dissemination and exploitation actions carried out within the TechTraPlastiCE project framework, and includes all the work areas (tasks) mentioned above (D.5.2, D.5.3, D.5.4 and D.5.5).\nAll these activities support the TechTraPlastiCE Project in the development of a coherence communication, unified appearance and the creation of the Project branding. Therefore, the digital dissemination materials and tools will be accessible at any time. One of the main difficulties in a big consortium is the distribution of communication and delivery of timely information. To this aim, partner’s training will help to ensure each partner understands its role, the channels, and the means to create accurate and proper content for the different channels. The formation of a communication team with representatives from all partners institutions will be key to ensure the correct implementation of this plan. WP5´s leader will monitor the dissemination efforts of the consortium on a regular basis.\nConsidering that communication is a dynamic process, WP5´s leader will regularly provide updates of the dissemination Plan according to the partners’ needs and will provide support in the organization of events from other WPs when it comes to dissemination tools and branding."

Relevant stakeholders will be continuously provided with updated information regarding project activities, news and events. All results will be solely promoted among the partners’ national and international networks.\n\nLevels of dissemination\nAs stated in the Proposal, the Dissemination and Exploitation Plan strategy consider four levels:\n\nInstitutional level: To create awareness and branding influence within each HEI community (leaders, administrators, professors, researchers, students, etc.).\nSocio-economic actors: It refers to companies leaders, leaders of associations of waste-pickers, local public authorities interested in sustainability, plastics and circular economy, and the society at large.\nConsortium: Targeting all European and Latin-American partners\nInternational/Regional level: To impact other non-partners, HEIS, associations or organizations interested in the project’s objectives at international and regional level.\n\n\n\nTarget Groups\nConsidering the differents levels of dissemination, the main target groups of the TechTraPlatiCE project are the following:\n\nTarget group 1: Project Stakeholders\n\nEach HIE community (students, researchers, professors, administrators, authorities)\nCompanies leaders and leaders of associations of waste-pickers.\n\n\n\nTarget group 2: Relevant Stakeholders\n\nOther non-partners, HEIS associations or organizations interested in the project’s objectives at international and regional level.\n\n\n\nTarget group 3: Policymakers\n\nPublic authorities interested in sustainability at local, regional, international level\n\n\n\nTarget group 4: General Public\n\nSociety at large and potential stakeholders\n\n\n\nTarget group 5: Press\n\nPress in general and media specialized in the project themes.\n\nA matrix message will be provided in order to define the messages for each target group, reaching our communication goals described above. (See Annex Section 4 - Message Matrix)\n\n\n\nContacts list\nGiven the fact that all partners together have a large network, each partner is going to draft and keep updated a stakeholder list, in order to guarantee that dissemination activities are specifically targeted and content is adapted to the needs of the diverse target groups.\nTaking into account all the existing contacts in EU and LA partner countries, promotional materials will be delivered both online and offline to the target audience and beyond. Online dissemination will be preferred for cost-efficiency reasons, but most importantly, to reduce the amount of paper used and hence, protect the environment. See Annex Section 5 - Contact list for dissemination\nIn the case of the “HIEs community” target, each partner institution will be responsible for sending or forwarding the content within their communities (students, researchers, professors, administrators, authorities).\nSimilarly, in the case of the target “Press”, each university will have to send the news to its local media contacts to ensure greater impact."

    "text": "Dissemination and Exploitation channels\nIn order to delivering the right message to the right person, this Dissemination Plan contemplates the following channels:\n\nA dedicated project website (D5.3)\nA first version of the TechTraPlastiCE website (techtraplastice.eu) was created in February 2025 for the kick off meeting and the final version will be online within the three first months of the project (June 2025).\nIt will be the main platform of the project, as it will be the only one to have the most clearly structured, complete and updated public information of the project for the broad public and all target groups. The website will be actively cross-linked with other websites and platforms which add value to the TechTraPlastiCE dissemination. Further, the website will include a contact form in order to give the possibility to get in contact with the consortium whenever needed.\nAll communication actions -described in this Plan or not- should lead to the website for more information and to contact the project management.\nThe website will be updated on a monthly basis. WP5 leader will be in charge of designing, administering and keeping updated the TechTraPlastiCE website with the collaboration of all the partners. To this aim, a mensual calendar will be shared to define the content generation by each partner for NEWS and AGENDA sections. Further, given the fact that EACEA follows the concept of knowledge sharing, the most important content deliverables of the project will be uploaded after completion on the website to guarantee easy access.\nTemplates will be provided to send the content as it is expected, including all the kind of information needed and the requirements of the image format with the corresponding assignment of image using rights. [cf Delivrable 5.2: Visual Identity Plan and Dissemination Materials]\nThis Plan also considers each partner’s institutional website as channels of communication, as they will replicate content (news and events) and will also have a visible and direct link to the main website of the Project on a permanent section. See the Project Folder.\n\n\nSocial Media (D5.3)\nLinkedIn and X (@techtraplastice) were defined as the most suitable social media network for the TechTraPlastiCE Project to disseminate its results and to engage with a broader audience. A YouTube channel of the project will also be created to host all the audiovisual material of the project, which will be also linked to the website, newsletters and other social networks, as appropriate. Partners have to follow the project’s accounts, replicate the content and comment to generate interaction.\nThe WP5, with the collaboration of all partners, will create content considering other social media networks to be shared by the partners through their institutional accounts, such as Instagram.\n6.3. E-mail: It will be the official and direct contact to the project administration (info@techtraplastice.eu). The contact form on the project website will be deliverable to this email address, that will replicate with an automatic response leading the different consortium contacts to guarantee the correct access to the information.\n6.4. Digital Newsletter: A semestral email from info@techtraplastice.eu will be sent to the different targets (collaboratives contact list) to facilitate the access to update information of the project.\nAs stated before, TechTraPlastiCE proposes the use of technology not only to use the project’s funds efficiently but also to communicate and promote a clean campus environment at the same time. This project will run for 3 years and as a means to inform the campus community of the advance of the project, partner institutions will use current technology to provide electronic information displays rather than distributing too many paper flyers.\nPublication of e-newsletters are expected to be done on a regular basis (every 6 months) also considering project calendar and main deliverables. It will be distributed via email to a database of interested people and institutions by each partner. It will also be uploaded on the TechTraPlastiCE website and social media channels.\nIt will include a subscription form to collect contacts of persons and institutions interested in the project.\n\n\nOpen Digital Repository (D5.4)\nAn open-source repository will be included on the project website for sharing the digital materials produced in different WP, especially targeting multi-stakeholders, interactive and friendly access. All project outputs (comparative analysis, training materials, etc.) will be transformed in an Open Educational Resources (OERs) available also after project ends to access and download. The OERs derived from TechTrasPlastiCE implementation will remain public on the project’s website and linked to LA HEIs websites. Project website and social media profile will be kept up and running after the project ends, still offering learning and dissemination opportunities. Different stakeholders will be able to reach, to access and use project results.\n\n\nBrochure\nIn order to provide detailed information to all target groups, the consortium members will establish a TechTraPlastiCE brochure. It will be designed in order to attract a high number of interested people and to be able to distinguish TechTraPlastiCE from the high number of other European projects.\n\n\nPress Releases\nIt is expected that each partner sends news and update information to the press and specialised media.\n\n\nEvents\nTargeted conferences, workshops and seminars for stakeholders and policymakers. Each partner should participate and disseminate the project and relevant results in Regional and European conferences to disseminate the project and its results.\nTo strengthen the international impact of TechTraPlatiCE’s results, project partners will take advantage of international conferences they will attend, in order to present the project’s progress and results. Search Conferences, the Final Conference (D5.3) of TechTraPlastiCE Project will be organized by UNRN on 2028 in San Carlos de Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina- are included in this point.\nOne important aspect of dissemination will always be face-to-face communication with the potential target groups given the fact that this type of communication can create a much higher impact as it is connected with a higher level of emotions. Therefore, dissemination of ThecTraPlastiCE activities and results will follow the guidelines of this plan and will be operated under the responsibility and financing of each partner (co-financing and co-responsibility)."

In that sense, the major goals as coordinator of the project regarding the differents deliverables of TechTraPlastiCE project are:\n\nDeliverables are designed to enhance proficiency in project management, thereby supporting more effective project execution and oversight.\nDeliverables meet the specific requirements of project lead beneficiaries, partners representatives, the project coordinator, and ultimately, the European Union.\nDeliverables are aligned with industry best practices in project management, ensuring quality and consistency across project outputs.\nDeliverables are prepared for web delivery and dissemination respecting the visual identity requirements (cf. Deliverable 5.2), with the exception of those classified as confidential.\nDeliverables are clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly. They provide all necessary information required by Partners to effectively progress in relevant tasks, minimizing the need for additional clarification, integration requests, or supplementary data.\nProject management practices conform to the Project Management Plan** (Deliverable D6.2), ensuring alignment with approved methodologies and standards.\n\nTherefore, the project quality committee (PQC) is putted in place during the whole project taking into account three majors roles:\n\nValidation the timely fulfillment of the obligations acquired and approving the quality of the working packages’ deliverables.\nOversee the execution of the working packages, assuring that both inputs and outputs meet predefined performance criteria, and that all tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.\nIdentification of the use of resources—human, financial, and material—to guarantee optimal utilization, alerting in a preventive manner if particular tasks will need additional support.\n\nThese three elements are the heart of the quality management of the project. Any proposed modifications to the quality plan must be formally reviewed and approved through a defined revision process, led by the PQC and finalized with the approval of the project coordinator.\nThis process ensures that all changes are tracked, documented, and communicated clearly across the project team, reinforcing consistency and traceability.\nFor doing that, five major principles will be assured throughout the project duration in order to guarantee a pertinent quality management process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of TechTraPlastice Quality Committee\n\n\n\n\nRespect: Understood as the consideration and appreciation of the work of the other actors involved in the project, as well as respect for the environment and activities that promote its appreciation and conservation.\nTransparency: it specifies that any information addressed to the PQC, consortium, general public, or stakeholders of the project will be easily accessible and easy to understand, and clear language shall be used. This principle also stipulates free access to meeting minutes and always having a clear and honest response regarding decision-making mechanisms.\nAccountability: it assigns clear roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations to each project partner and governing body. In the TechTraplastiCe project, each institution is held responsible for their commitments, outputs, and use of resources. Mechanisms for regular performance evaluation, issue resolution, and corrective action are integral to this principle, ensuring that all project activities are conducted with integrity and aligned with agreed standards and objectives.\nStrategic Alignment: it ensures that all project activities, decisions, and resource allocations are consistently guided by the project’s overarching goals, priorities, and intended impacts. This principle implies that efforts remain focused, coherent, and capable of delivering measurable value throughout the project duration.\nCooperation: it emphasizes the importance of open dialogue, trust, and shared commitment among all partners of TechtraplastiCE. It will foster a working environment where partners actively contribute to common goals, align efforts, and resolve challenges collectively ensuring that the project implementation will benefit from the collective expertise, resources, and engagement of the entire consortium."

    "text": "This document presents the first deliverable of Work Package 1 (WP1) of the TechTraPlastiCE project: a comparative framework to understand the barriers and benefits associated with the application of local legislation in the plastics sector in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. The main objective of this deliverable is to provide a shared baseline seeking to better understand the transition toward a circular economy by identifying regulatory structures, institutional gaps, and key stakeholders across the plastic value chain among the three countries.\nThe methodology was designed on the basis of a common understanding of consortium. It consisted in four major steps: 1) identification of the legislation in terms of circular economy public policies on plastics for each country, 2) organization and analysis of secondary data to identify barriers and leviers that stakeholders of the plastic value chain will be confronted , and 3) socialization workshop during the kick-off meeting in order to confront the particular results in order to find major patterns among the countries. This collaborative process enabled preliminary findings of common barriers and leviers and validated. Finally, 4) each institution subsequently submitted a national report, which was reviewed and synthesized in this comparative framework.\nThe findings highlight that while the three countries have made progress in enacting regulations targeting single-use plastics, improving recycling, and promoting circular strategies, there remain important challenges to tackle. These include for instance 1) uneven implementation across territories, 2) insufficient incentives for circular innovation, and limited coordination between public and private actors, 3) regulatory frameworks are at different stages of maturity, having for example the Chile a consolidated structure, while Colombia context is undergoing a rapid development, and Argentina presented strong localized initiatives but lacking national cohesion.\nThe analysis of the plastic value chain, presented in general terms in this report, reveals similarities in structure, with key differences in resin production capacity and the integration of waste pickers. Argentina and Colombia produce plastic resins domestically, while Chile relies on imports. In all three countries, municipalities lead waste management services, but coverage and infrastructure gaps persist, particularly in rural areas. The formalization of recyclers is more advanced in Colombia, while in Argentina and Chile, cooperatives operate with variable levels of recognition and support. A more detailed assessment of the value chain and actor dynamics will be carried out in upcoming WP1 deliverables.\nThe conclusions of this framework emphasize the need for improved regulatory coherence, investment in waste valorization systems, and strengthened collaboration between actors. Higher education institutions play a key role in this transition by fostering applied research, policy dialogue, and the co-creation of training and innovation initiatives. This deliverable will serve as a baseline for the development of targeted tools and actions in the following work packages."

Its purpose is to foster innovation, technology transfer, and collaboration between universities, businesses, and other key stakeholders, contributing to closing circular gaps in local ecosystems.\nIn this context, the present deliverable, “Framework to understand barriers and benefits to apply with local legislation”, seeks to identify existing regulatory frameworks in the participating countries and to understand the factors that enable or hinder their effective implementation. This framework will help to recognize the benefits and barriers that companies face when applying local legislation related to plastic management and the circular economy, providing a shared foundation to guide future project activities such as tool development, technical training, and pilot implementation.\nThis document presents the findings concisely and is structured to ensure accessibility for a broad audience. The annexes include detailed national and regulatory information.\nThis framework and the upcoming results from WP1 will support the other work packages by providing a common understanding of regulatory environments, barriers, and opportunities for circular economy adoption in the plastics sector, as illustrated in Figure 1. It supports the identification of policy gaps, opportunities for collaboration with industry and government, and country-specific conditions that will inform future work packages. Moreover, it is a baseline for developing targeted policy recommendations, innovation pilots, and capacity-building actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: WP1 baseline for TechTraplastiCE Project"

    "section": "Plastics, Circular economy and value chain context",
    "text": "Plastics, Circular economy and value chain context\nPlastics are deeply embedded in global economic activity due to their low cost, durability, and wide range of applications. Global plastic production reached approximately 460 million tons in 2019, having doubled since 2000. The global plastic market was valued at €535 billion in 2019 and is projected to grow at a rate of 3.2% annually, potentially tripling by 2060, according to the OECD.\nIn line with this diagnosis, the United Nations Environment Program report (UNEP, 2018) identifies Latin America and the Caribbean as one of the regions with the highest losses of macroplastics to the environment, with approximately 0.89 million tons per year coming mainly from poorly managed solid waste. It is estimated that around 31% of plastic waste in the region does not receive adequate treatment, which increases its environmental impact, especially in marine environments. Despite representing only 4% of global plastics production, regional consumption reaches 8%, reflecting growing pressure on local management systems.\nThe study also points out that the polymers most frequently found as microplastics in marine ecosystems include Polypropylene (PP), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), whose sources range from the wear and tear of consumer products and washing of synthetic textiles, to the degradation of macroplastics. In this sense, the strengthening of circular economy strategies in the region should consider interventions along the entire plastic value chain, promoting policies that prevent losses at the use and final disposal stage, as well as solutions for priority sectors such as packaging, fishing, and construction.\nAwareness and actions around plastic pollution have intensified in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in recent years, positioning the region as a growing force in the global transition toward circular plastics management. Today, 27 of the 33 countries in the region have enacted national or local legislation to reduce, restrict, or ban single-use plastics. However, recycling and recovery rates remains below 10%, while plastics continue to represent 10–12% of municipal solid waste in many countries. Houssini and Tan (2025), reported that incineration is the prominent waste disposal method (34%), while landfill is decreasing substantially (40%), and global recycling remained stagnant (9%).\nIn line with these challenges, the Cities Network on Plastic Circular Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean was launched in March 2025, as part of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) project to Reduce Marine Plastics and Plastic Pollution in Cities, under a circular economy approach. This network, promoted by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Cartagena Convention, brings together cities such as Barranquilla, Cartagena, Kingston, Montego Bay, Panama City and Colon, with the aim of sharing experiences, articulating good practices and promoting replicable local solutions to address plastic pollution. This initiative marks a concrete step forward in the implementation of circular strategies at the municipal level, strengthening local capacities and promoting sustainable models that include the integration of recyclers, the protection of urban ecosystems, and the creation of green jobs. The network is expected to expand to new cities, consolidating a coordinated regional agenda that promotes the circularity of plastic throughout its value chain.\nRegarding policy making and regulatory framework, countries like Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Panama have passed significant laws to regulate plastic production and consumption, while others such as Ecuador and Costa Rica are advancing marine litter strategies and local bans. The launch of regional networks, such as the Cities Network on Plastic Circular Economy, signals the emergence of collaborative platforms aimed at knowledge exchange and replicable solutions. These efforts not only highlight political will but also reveal the need to strengthen enforcement, develop inclusive value chains, and support innovation at the municipal level.\nTo better understand how circularity can be advanced, it is essential to analyze the plastics value chain, which encompasses all stages in the life cycle of plastic materials, from raw material production to waste recovery and valorization. The diagram presented in Figure 2 illustrates the plastics value chain in simplified terms, showing the flow from raw materials (petroleum, natural gas, and plant-based inputs) to polymer production (bioplastics, fossil-based plastics, and recycled plastics), and finally to the processing and machining stages that lead to a wide variety of plastic products. It also emphasizes the key sectors where these products are used, such as packaging, construction, and textiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic description of a generic plastics value chain.\n\n\n\nIt is also essential to consider the post-consumption stages of the value chain, showed schematically in Figure 3, including disposal, recycling, and/or valorization, which are critical for enabling a circular approach and reducing environmental impacts. These stages define whether plastic materials can be reintegrated into the productive cycle or result in pollution and resource loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Schematic description of post-consumption flow of plastics.\n\n\n\nA wide range of actors participate in these stages, including government agencies, producers and transformers, distributors, waste managers, recyclers, academia, and civil society organizations. The degree of formalization, coordination, and engagement of these stakeholders varies across countries and has a direct impact on the success of circular strategies.\nThe present framework addresses both the regulatory context and the structure of the value chain, with the goal of identifying barriers and enablers for advancing circular economy practices in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia."

This section provides a comparative analysis of national legislation, policy instruments, and international commitments relevant to plastics and the circular economy in Argentina, Chile and Colombia.\nThese countries present distinct regulatory contexts, influenced by their institutional structures and the maturity of their circular economy strategies. Rather than listing individual laws, the following table presents a synthesized interpretation of the main regulatory characteristics observed in each country. It highlights general trends, implementation gaps, and the level of alignment between policy goals and regulatory mechanisms.\nMore detailed national-level information, including specific laws and policy instruments, can be found in Annexes Section 7 (Argentina), Section 8 (Chile), and Section 9 (Colombia).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Regulatory And Policy Frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\nArgentina\nChile\nColombia\n\n\n\n\nPlastic Regulatory Framework\nIt has general and sectoral environmental laws but lacks an integrated, plastic-specific regulatory framework at the national level.

However, the framework is still being developed and progressively regulated.\n\n\nCircular Economy Public Policies\nSome initiatives have been launched, but many are fragmented or discontinued. The lack of coordination across jurisdictions limits their long-term impact. Circular economy is referenced in laws and resolutions, but not yet integrated as a core policy framework; efforts vary by province.\nLong-term strategies exist with measurable targets and clear guidelines. There is strong articulation among ministries and public actors. Circular economy is institutionalized with cross-cutting strategies like the 2040 Roadmap.\nActive national circular economy strategy (2019) complemented by city-level efforts like Bogotá’s circular policy (2023) and sectoral plans.

    "text": "Plastic value chian and key stakeholders\nAlthough no field validation has yet been conducted, and national value chain mappings remain at a general level, preliminary findings suggest that the plastic value chains in the three participating countries follow a relatively similar structure, involving stages from raw material supply to final recovery or disposal. These similarities should be interpreted cautiously, as they may conceal contextual differences that will be explored in further WP1 deliverables. However, there are notable differences in the availability of local production capacity, the level of integration of recyclers, and the formalization of value chain actors.\nOne of the most significant differences lies in the production of raw materials. While Argentina and Colombia have domestic petrochemical industries capable of producing plastic resins (e.g., in Bahía Blanca and through national companies in Colombia), Chile does not produce plastic resins and depends entirely on imports. This difference influences the level of industrial self-sufficiency and the integration of upstream actors in the national ecosystem.\nIn the manufacturing and transformation stage, the three countries are home to a mix of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with some participation of large companies in sectors such as packaging and consumer goods. While innovation initiatives and ecodesign practices are emerging, particularly in Chile and Colombia, the degree of adoption is still limited across the region, especially among smaller firms.\nThe distribution and consumption stage is marked by growing public awareness of plastic pollution and, in some cases, by regulatory pressures encouraging sustainable consumption practices. However, engagement levels vary depending on local policies, retail structures, and consumer behavior.\nThe collection and waste management stage shows stronger similarities. In all three countries, municipalities play a central role in solid waste management, with a combination of public and private service providers. Nevertheless, there are considerable gaps in infrastructure coverage, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nFinally, in the recovery and recycling stage, the three countries rely heavily on waste picker cooperatives and informal workers, although the degree of formalization differs. Colombia stands out for its national strategy to formalize recyclers and integrate them into public service provision. In Argentina, cooperatives play a key role but operate under varying degrees of recognition and support depending on the province. In Chile, formal recycling companies are more present in urban centers, and informal participation is limited and less integrated into national recovery systems.\nOverall, the value chain in the region remains marked by fragmentation and unequal distribution of resources and capabilities. Strengthening collaboration between actors, improving the recognition of recyclers, and investing in collection and valorization infrastructure are critical steps to move toward a more circular plastic economy.\nCross-Country Observations\n\nAll three countries exhibit a concentration of formalized actors in the early stages (production, manufacturing), while later stages (collection and valorization) depend more heavily on local government initiatives and informal labor.\nThe level of integration and support for recyclers varies significantly, with Colombia standing out for its policies on formalization.\nThere is room to enhance university-industry collaboration throughout the chain to support training, applied research, and pilot development."

    "text": "INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES THAT INFLUENCE THE REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PLASTICS IN ARGENTINA\nArgentina has signed and ratified several international human rights treaties, many of which have constitutional status as established in Article 75, Section 22 of the National Constitution. One of these treaties is the American Convention on Human Rights, also known as the “Pact of San José de Costa Rica”. This Convention was signed in 1969. It was not until 1988 that the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in economic, social, and cultural rights, known as the “Protocol of San Salvador,” was signed. Article 11 of this Protocol establishes the “Right to a Healthy Environment” that every citizen has. Likewise, the aforementioned law stipulates that the States Parties to the Convention must promote environmental protection, preservation, and improvement.\nIt is worth mentioning that before the San Salvador Protocol, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held within the framework of the United Nations in 1972. This event stands out as the first global conference on the environment. It is also important to highlight that this event resulted in a Declaration of 26 principles for environmental protection and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) creation.\nIn 1989, the Basel Convention was signed and approved by Law 23,922. It regulates the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and its disposal to protect human health and the environment. It establishes strict controls on this waste’s export, import, and disposal, promoting its environmentally sound management. It also encourages reducing hazardous waste generation and treating hazardous waste as close as possible to its source.\nIn 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, known as the “Earth Summit”, was held in Rio de Janeiro. The Declaration on Environment and Development is a milestone. It contains 27 Principles, among which Principle 8 is worth mentioning. This establishes that “States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of production and consumption”. Similarly, Principle 10 is worth noting, as it establishes the foundations for access to participation, information, and justice in environmental matters. Principles 15 (Precautionary Measures) and 16 (Prevention) deserve special mention, as they lay the foundations upon which much environmental legislation was later built. The conference also gave rise to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, approved by our country under Law 24,295. In addition, the Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted and approved by Argentina under Law 24,375.\nIn 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was approved within the United Nations framework. It puts the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change into effect, committing industrialized countries to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This international agreement was approved by Law 25,438.\nOn September 25, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda through Resolution 70/1. While it does not have the same legal status as an International Agreement or Treaty, meaning it is not binding on States, it lists global objectives to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each objective has specific targets to be achieved, including “Responsible Consumption and Production,” “Sustainable Cities and Communities,” “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” and others.\nIn 2015, at the annual summit of countries that have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement (ratified by Law 27.270) was signed. This agreement urges member states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.\nIn 2018, the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation, and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean was signed within the framework of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. This agreement regulates Principle 10 of the Rio de Janeiro Declaration. It has been ratified by Law 27,566.\nIn 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly issued Resolution 14. This resolution paves the way for adopting a specific International Treaty to end plastic pollution.\nDuring 2024, the United Nations Environment Assembly held sessions and even agreed on an informal document to serve as the basis for drafting this international agreement."

Plastic production is carried out through industrial activity, so the waste management from said production is regulated by National Law 25.612 (on industrial waste management).\nThe main laws and regulations in force are highlighted below:\na. Law No. 25.612 on Industrial Waste Management: This was the first minimum environmental protection law passed after the constitutional reform. It sets requirements for the comprehensive management of industrial waste and service-related waste throughout Argentina. It also addresses the civil liability of waste generators, transporters, treatment plants, and disposal facilities, and mandates a transport manifest system. As plastic production is generally an industrial activity, waste generated from this process is governed by this law.\nb. Law No. 25.916 and Regulatory Decree 779/22: These regulate household waste management and are complemented by General Environmental Law No. 25.675, which lays out environmental policy principles and management instruments, such as environmental education, access to information, and civil liability for environmental damage. Law 25.916 promotes waste recovery, circular economy with social inclusion, and mandates a registry of waste recovery workers in each jurisdiction.\nc. Law No. 24.051 on Hazardous Waste: Although passed before the 1994 constitutional reform and not considered a minimum budget law, it applies throughout the country and establishes criminal liabilities. It includes plastics classified as hazardous due to their composition or use. Provinces such as Río Negro have complementary laws like Law No. 3250 for special wastes.\nd. Resolution 407/2019 (Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development): This resolution promotes environmentally sound management of plastics throughout their life cycle, aiming to reduce water pollution from plastics and microplastics. It also encourages circular economy practices and technological innovation.\ne. Draft Law on Packaging for Social Inclusion: Currently under legislative discussion, this bill aims to promote responsible packaging management and support urban recyclers. It is designed to reduce environmental and health impacts caused by packaging waste.\nf. Law No. 27.602 on Cosmetic and Oral Hygiene Products: This law prohibits the use of intentionally added plastic microbeads in cosmetics and oral hygiene products, including their importation and commercialization.\ng. National Parks Resolution No. 19/20: Prohibits the use of single-use plastics in all National Parks across the country.\nh. Law No. 27.279: Regulates the management of empty pesticide containers to ensure safe collection, temporary storage, and recycling or reuse.\ni. Law No. 25.831: Guarantees the public’s right to access environmental information, promoting transparency and accountability in environmental governance.\nj. Law No. 27.621 and Law No. 27.592: These establish comprehensive environmental education and training for public sector employees, focusing on sustainability, equity, and climate change awareness.\nk. Law No. 27.520: Passed in the context of the Paris Agreement, this law sets minimum standards for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in Argentina.\nl. Law No. 25.688: Regulates environmental water management, setting standards for sustainable water use and identifying relevant activities."

However, it failed to achieve further development. Recently, a new push was seen in the implementation of circular economy policies, with the Directorate of Sustainable Industry (DIS), which includes the promotion of the sustainable development of national industry through productive reconversion processes among its responsibilities. Along the same lines, the formation of Technical Working Groups on the Circular Economy, promoted by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, is also being promoted. Likewise, the Association for the Study of Solid Waste (ARS) promoted the development of a National Circular Economy Strategy in 2019."

In our country, 50,000 tons of waste are produced every day. Half of this waste ends up in one of the more than 5,000 open-air dumps in the country or, at best, in a sanitary landfill. Approximately 20% of the urban solid waste generated is post-consumer packaging, including various types of plastic.\nWaste management in Argentina still requires a planned public policy that integrates the recycling production chain, provides adequate machinery for the treatment of recyclable waste (balers, conveyors, hoppers, trucks, etc.), formalizes existing jobs and creates new ones, develops regional economies, and allows for import substitution. This policy also implements local recycling systems with social inclusion, fostering productive recycling networks, and guarantees social rights for urban recyclers."

    "text": "NATIONAL REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION, USE AND DISPOSAL OF PLASTICS\nThis section presents the main laws promoted in Chile to facilitate the transition to a circular economy.\na. Law 20.920: Establishes a framework for waste management, extended producer responsibility and recycling promotion\nLaw 20.920, known as the Extended Producer Responsibility and Recycling Promotion Law, was enacted in Chile on May 17, 2016, to improve waste management in the country by promoting recycling and other forms of recovery. This law establishes a regulatory framework for solid waste management, promoting producer responsibility and the participation of citizens and businesses in recycling and waste reduction.\nThis law compels industrial producers and importers of specific products, such as containers and packaging, tires, lubricating oils, batteries, electrical and electronic devices, and cells, to organize and finance the management of waste derived from their products once they reach the end of their useful life. This includes collection, transportation, storage, recovery, or final disposal, either directly or in collaboration with other companies, following traceability, efficiency, and transparency standards.\nOne of the principles underlying this law is the waste management hierarchy, prioritizing waste prevention, reuse and recycling of waste or one or more of its components, and the total or partial recovery of waste for energy, with disposal as the last option. Furthermore, this law recognizes the importance of including “base-recyclers”1, facilitating their integration through training, financing, and certification mechanisms.\nThe law is implemented progressively through specific supreme decrees for each priority product. These decrees set collection and recovery targets and other obligations such as ecodesign, consumer education, and traceability. They also regulate management systems, which may be individual or collective and must be duly authorized.\nThe Environmental Superintendency (SMA) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the law, and its implementation is complemented by support instruments such as the Recycling Fund and environmental education programs.\nThis law has a particularly significant impact on the plastics sector, as packaging constitutes one of the main sources of plastic waste and is considered a priority product under this legal framework. Therefore, Law 20.920 is one of Chile’s most important instruments for the transition to a circular economy.\nb. Law 21.100: Prohibits the distribution of plastic shopping bags throughout the national territory\nLaw No. 21,100, enacted in 2018, bans the use of plastic bags in stores throughout the country. This regulation aims to protect the environment by gradually eliminating a type of plastic waste that is widely distributed but has a high environmental impact and low recyclability.\nThis regulation prohibits commercial establishments from providing plastic shopping bags. This prohibition excludes only those bags used as primary food packaging, when their use is necessary for hygienic reasons or to prevent waste.\nThe municipalities enforce this law, applying sanctions through local police courts. Non-compliance can be punished with a fine of up to five monthly tax units (UTM2) for each bag delivered.\nFurthermore, the law states that the Ministry of the Environment develops environmental education programs for citizens to inform them about the ecological impact of these bags and promote reusable and sustainable alternatives.\nLaw 21.100 represented a milestone in Chilean environmental legislation. It was the first national law to ban a single-use plastic product, setting a regulatory precedent that influenced the subsequent development of other laws and strategies related to the circular economy, such as Law 21.368.\nc. Law 21.368: Regulates the delivery of single-use plastics and plastic bottles, and modifies the legal bodies that indicate\nLaw 21,368, the Single-Use Plastics Law, was enacted in Chile on August 6, 2021. It prohibits the use of single-use plastics in the food market, such as cutlery, bottles, cups, and straws. The law aims to protect the environment and reduce waste generation by encouraging reusable alternatives and promoting material recovery and composting.\nThis legislation prohibits restaurants, cafes, and similar establishments from providing single-use utensils for on-site consumption, regardless of their material, and prioritizes using returnable and reusable utensils. For off-site consumption, disposable products are permitted only if made from recyclable materials other than plastic or certified plastic, defined as compostable and composed of renewable raw materials.\nRegarding plastic bottles, the law requires that disposable bottles incorporate a minimum percentage of recycled plastic collected in Chile, which will progressively increase by 2060. Likewise, beverage retailers (such as supermarkets and convenience stores) must offer returnable bottles, set up dedicated shelves for their sale, and accept the return of these containers from consumers.\nMunicipalities are responsible for enforcing this law, and penalties can reach up to 20 UTM per violation, depending on the type and severity of the violation. The Ministry of the Environment (MMA) certifies plastics and bottles and may delegate verification to entities accredited by the Environmental Superintendency.\nFinally, the law promotes environmental education programs on the ecological impact of disposable products and encourages composting, especially at the municipal level. Law 21,368 deepens the country’s circular economy approach, reinforcing regulatory commitment to reducing unnecessary plastics and transitioning to more sustainable materials and reuse systems."

    "text": "RELEVANT PUBLIC POLICIES TO PROMOTE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE PLASTICS SECTOR\na. National Organic Waste Strategy\nThe National Organic Waste Strategy (ENRO) is a policy promoted by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) that establishes a roadmap for transforming Chile’s organic waste management model.\nIts objectives are to reduce organic waste in landfills, representing 58% of municipal solid waste. This is achieved by converting it into valuable resources such as compost, biogas, or energy, thereby mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) that result from waste decomposition in landfills.\nCurrently, the waste recovery rate is less than 1%. This strategy aims to increase the rate from 1% to 66% at the municipal level by 2040, increasing the coverage of organic waste collection systems and promoting the implementation of composting and anaerobic digestion treatment plants.\nTo achieve this, a series of actions are established to be taken, such as:\n\nSeparate organic waste at source.\nImplement infrastructure for composting and anaerobic digestion.\nRaise awareness and train the population in environmental education\nDevelop markets for products based on revalorization.\n\nAlthough this strategy focuses on the recovery of organic waste, it indirectly affects the plastics sector, as it promotes the classification of household waste into three streams: organic waste, containers and packaging (which includes plastics), and disposable waste. This approach facilitates the proper management of recyclable plastics under the REP Law, preventing their contamination with organic matter and improving their recovery. Furthermore, by promoting compostability and establishing mechanisms for the certification of compostable products, such as single-use plastic containers and utensils, the strategy indirectly contributes to the reduction of non-recyclable plastics and their replacement with more sustainable alternatives.\nb. Circular Economy Roadmap in Chile to 2040\nThe Roadmap is a strategic plan developed by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), in conjunction with the Ministry of Economy, the Production Development Corporation (CORFO), and the Agency for Sustainability and Climate Change (ASCC), which seeks to transform the country’s economic model into a more sustainable one.\nThe vision for 2040 is for Chile to have consolidated a regenerative development model, adopting a logic that preserves the value of natural resources and materials in the economy for as long as possible. To achieve this, concrete short-, medium-, and long-term goals have been defined, structured around four strategic axes: circular innovation, circular culture, circular regulation, and circular institutionality. These axes are addressed through lines of action that include public policy instruments, capacity building, education and awareness-raising, economic incentives, and regulatory reforms.\nOne of the core elements of this roadmap is the creation of enabling conditions to facilitate the transition, including appropriate legal frameworks, financial incentives, multi-level governance mechanisms, and the development of data and indicators. Given their high impact and potential for transformation, it also recognizes priority sectors for implementing the circular economy, such as the plastics, construction, food, and mining industries.\nIn this way, the Circular Economy Roadmap for Chile 2040 establishes a comprehensive framework for the country’s progress toward sustainable development, balancing economic growth with environmental protection.\nc. Environmental education campaigns\nEnvironmental education is a fundamental tool for the transition to a circular economy, as it allows for raising awareness, changing consumption habits, and strengthening citizen participation in sustainable resource management. In Chile, a series of environmental education campaigns promoted by both the public sector and private organizations seek to promote practices such as source separation, reducing the use of single-use plastics, home composting, and the adoption of reusable alternatives.\nFrom the public sector, the Ministry of the Environment has developed multiple national campaigns, such as “Choose to Reuse,” focused on reducing the use of single-use plastics and promoting responsible consumption habits; “I Recycle,” aimed at separating waste under the REP Law; and, more recently, initiatives linked to the implementation of Law 21,368, which requires establishments to inform and raise awareness among consumers about the environmental impact of single-use products. Audiovisual materials, educational guides, workshops, and collaborative initiatives with municipalities, academic centers, and social organizations often accompany these campaigns.\nAt the local level, municipalities have also developed their environmental education programs, integrating circular economy content into community activities, fairs, workshops, and school programs. In parallel, civil society organizations, businesses, and academic institutions have led campaigns focused on specific topics, such as packaging reuse, conscious consumption, and inclusive recycling, focusing on grassroots recyclers.\nThese campaigns help raise awareness among the public and the productive sector regarding the plastics problem, climate change, and the need to move toward production and consumption models based on the circular economy.\nREFERENCES\nChilean National Congress.

    "text": "INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES THAT INFLUENCE THE REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PLASTICS IN COLOMBIA\nVarious international legal instruments address proper waste management, adapting to the needs of each type of business. The international conventions mentioned are related to environmental protection and human health. Some of the most relevant treaties are presented below:\na. Basel Convention: Although not exclusively focused on plastics, the Basel Convention regulates the transboundary movement of hazardous waste, including certain types of plastic waste. This convention seeks to prevent the transfer of hazardous waste from developed countries to developing countries, where waste management may be inadequate.\nb. Global Plastics Treaty and UNEA Resolution 5/14: This is an international agreement under development, driven by the United Nations (UN), which aims primarily to address plastic pollution throughout its life cycle. It seeks to establish a binding legal framework for countries and companies to reduce plastics’ production, consumption, and mishandling. Negotiations for this treaty are expected to be finalized by the end of 2024.\nUNEA Resolution 5/14: Adopted by the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in 2022, this resolution establishes the need for a legally binding international instrument to address plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. This resolution forms the basis for the development of the Global Plastics Treaty.\nThe international relevance of the circular economy is reflected in the support it has received from United Nations organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). To move toward a more sustainable economic model and reduce its environmental footprint, the European Union has developed a circular economy strategy based on key measures such as:\n\nSustainable design: Promotes the design of products and packaging that are durable, reusable, recyclable, and easy to repair.\nFunctionality economy: promoting business models based on payment for service or use, rather than product ownership\nCollection and Recycling: Sets important goals for recycling and landfill reduction, to recycle 65% of municipal waste and 75% of packaging by 2030.\nRegulations for single-use plastics: Impose restrictions and bans to reduce environmental impact.\nMore sustainable products: Develop eco-labelling standards and improve consumer information about product sustainability.\nInnovation and financing: Promote innovation in circular technologies and processes and provide financing for projects and companies that contribute to the circular economy.\nEducation and awareness: Educating citizens about the importance of the circular economy and encouraging changes in purchasing and consumption behavior.\nRenewable materials and resources: Promote using renewable and bio-based materials and resources instead of non-renewable resources.\n\nc. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has developed a series of standards for the circular economy and waste management that, while not mandatory for companies, offer a valuable opportunity to differentiate themselves. By adopting these standards, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and resource efficiency, thus complementing the requirements established by international legislation. Some of the most relevant standards are:\n\nISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems (EMS)) establishes the requirements for implementing environmental management systems, including waste management, to prevent pollution and define criteria for effective environmental management.\nISO 14031 (Environmental Management - Environmental Performance Assessment - Guidelines): Details how companies should conduct assessments of their environmental performance, with special attention to the management of hazardous and solid waste.\nISO 14040/14044 (Life Cycle Assessment): These standards focus on life cycle assessment, which is crucial for measuring the environmental impact of products and processes, from raw materials to disposal. These analyses facilitate decision-making and improve the circular economy.\n\nd. Escazú Agreement: This regional treaty guarantees access to information, public participation, and justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean. Colombia signed the Escazú Agreement on December 11, 2019, and the Colombian Constitutional Court declared Law 2273 of 2022, which approves the Agreement, constitutional and enforceable.\nAlthough it does not focus exclusively on plastics management, it promotes transparency and citizen participation in environmental decisions, including plastic waste management.\nThese agreements and treaties reflect Colombia’s commitment to the international community to address the problem of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices in managing these materials."

    "text": "NATIONAL REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION, USE AND DISPOSAL OF PLASTICS\nIn Colombia, the production, use, and disposal of plastics are regulated by several current national regulations that seek to mitigate the environmental impact of these materials. The main ones are highlighted below:\na. Resolution 1407 of 2018, amended by Resolution 1342 of 2020 \nIts purpose is to establish guidelines for the proper environmental management of packaging waste, promoting extended producer responsibility (EPR). This requires producers to implement systems for the collection, utilization, and final disposal of packaging waste. It also seeks to promote waste management by promoting source separation, recycling, and the utilization of packaging waste. It also establishes requirements for the proper final disposal of waste that cannot be reused.\nb. National Plan for the Sustainable Management of Single-Use Plastics \nIts central objective is to implement comprehensive plastic management. This will be achieved through prevention, reduction, reuse, utilization, and responsible consumption actions, while promoting new business opportunities, technological development, and job creation. The plan also defines product and outcome goals in key areas such as materials management, recycling, eco-design, and the reincorporation of plastics into the production cycle, all with the ultimate goal of protecting natural resources and strengthening the country’s competitiveness.\nc. Agreement 808 of 2021 \nProgressively prohibits the acquisition and consumption of single-use plastics in the Capital District entities that are part of the central, decentralized, and local sectors, promoting their replacement and closing of cycles.\nd. Law 2232 of 2022 \nTo safeguard the fundamental rights to life, health, and the enjoyment of a healthy environment, measures are established to reduce the production and consumption of single-use plastics in the national territory. Provisions are issued to allow for their gradual replacement with sustainable alternatives and their closing of cycles, and complementary measures are established.\nThe National Government has issued Decree 2192 of 2023, which regulates key aspects of Law 2232 of 2022, such as:\n\nBan on Specific Products: The introduction, marketing and distribution of single-use plastic products such as bags at payment points, balloon holders, mixers, straws, ice cream holders and expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) containers used for food and beverages is prohibited (cancilleria.gov.co ).\nNational Substitution Policy: The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development must develop a policy to reduce the production and consumption of single-use plastics and promote their replacement with sustainable alternatives ( cancilleria.gov.co).\nThe ban on single-use plastics in protected areas.\nStrengthening the plastics value chain, with an emphasis on professional recyclers.\nGuidelines for the biodegradability and compostability of plastics.\nA national tax is established on single-use plastic products for packaging, wrapping, or packing goods.\n\ne. Integrated Solid Waste Management Plans (PGIRS) \nThese are fundamental planning instruments in Colombia for properly managing waste, including plastics.\nRelationship with plastics management: The PGIRS plays a crucial role in implementing Law 2232 of 2022 and other regulations related to plastic reduction.\n\nPromote the separation of plastic waste at source.\nStrengthen selective plastic collection systems.\nPromote the recycling and use of plastics.\nRaise awareness among the population about the importance of reducing plastic consumption and managing it properly.\n\nf. Decree 2192 of 2023 \nThis decree regulates aspects of Law 2232 of 2022, including the prohibition of the entry of single-use plastics into protected areas and the promotion of the formalization of actors in the plastic value chain ( funcionpublica.gov.co).\ng. Resolution 0803 of 2024 \nThis resolution establishes a new framework for the management of plastics in Colombia, by which the provisions of Law 2232 of 2022 are partially developed, on the gradual reduction of the production and consumption of certain single-use plastic products, article 2.2.7C.7 of Decree 1076 of 2015 that establishes measures aimed at the gradual reduction of the production and consumption of certain single-use plastics and other provisions are adopted ( Resolution 0803 of June 24, 2024 -)\nh. NTC 6632:2022 \nThe conformity assessment process for products manufactured with 100% recycled plastic raw material from national post-consumer material must be carried out by the producer, who will request a certificate of compliance with NTC 6632:2022 “Traceability and conformity assessment of plastic recycling and recycled content” or the standard that modifies and replaces it from the third-party Conformity Assessment body.\n\nPUBLIC POLICIES TO PROMOTE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE PLASTICS SECTOR\nGlobal policies promote the circular economy for various sectors, including the plastics industry. These include:\n\nLaw 2125 of August 4, 2021: The Law gives the national Government one year to formulate a comprehensive public policy to promote women-led entrepreneurship. This design will be done through the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, which will develop technical, administrative, legal, and financial instruments to advise and implement projects that comprehensively contemplate female entrepreneurs’ promotion, investment, and training.\nConpes 4011 : This CONPES document seeks to generate enabling conditions in the entrepreneurial ecosystem for the creation, sustainability and growth of ventures that contribute to the generation of income, wealth and increases in business productivity and internationalization.\nCONPES 4069: New Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (2022-2031): The new policy seeks to increase the contribution of STI to the social, economic, environmental, and sustainable development of the country, with a differential, territorial, and participatory approach, to contribute to cultural changes that promote the consolidation of a knowledge society.\nResolution 276 of 2016: The purpose of this resolution is to establish the guidelines for the operational scheme of the activity of taking advantage of the public cleaning service and the transitional regime for the formalization of professional recyclers in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5of Title 2 of Part 3 of Decree No. 1077 of 2015 added by Decree No. 596of April 11, 2016.\nConpes 3874 of 2016: The focus of this policy is the management of non-hazardous waste and seeks to contribute to sustainable development and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Hazardous waste has its own dynamics and has policies and regulations that promote its prevention and minimization.\nNational Circular Economy Strategy/2020: This strategy seeks to promote innovation and value generation in production and consumption systems by optimizing, sharing, exchanging, recycling, and regenerating materials, water, and energy.\nBogotá DC District Public Policy on Circular Economy: The city of Bogotá has implemented a public policy on circular economy that seeks to promote sustainability and efficiency in the use of resources ( sdp.gov.co)\nPact for Plastics in Bogotá: The Bogotá District Secretariat for Economic Development has joined the “Pact for Plastics,” an initiative that seeks to promote the circular economy in plastics management. The actions proposed within this framework include strengthening training modules, providing technical assistance for the implementation of circular packaging guidelines, and promoting circular products, where waste from one sector can be used as input for another ( desarrolloeconomico.gov.co)."

    "section": "REGULATORY OR LEGAL BARRIERS THAT LIMIT THE TRANSITION OF COMPANIES TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY",
    "text": "REGULATORY OR LEGAL BARRIERS THAT LIMIT THE TRANSITION OF COMPANIES TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\nIn Colombia, the plastics sector’s transition to a circular economy faces several regulatory and legal barriers that hinder its progress. Some of the main ones are:\n\nNeed for a more coherent and unified policy:\n\nAlthough Colombia has made progress with regulations such as Law 2173 of 2021 (Circular Economy Law) and Resolution 1407 of 2018 (on packaging management), these are not always robust or specific enough to drive profound changes in the plastics sector. Furthermore, the lack of detailed regulations can create uncertainty for companies. Colombian regulations are also scattered and lack clear mechanisms for applying sanctions and benefits, which creates uncertainty in the sector (Law 1259 of 2008, Law 2232 of 2022, Decree 1076 of 2015).\n\nLack of clear incentives:\n\nThere are insufficient fiscal, tax, or financial incentives for companies to invest in technologies and processes that support the circular economy, such as advanced recycling, eco-design, or material reuse.\n\nDifficulties in waste management:\n\nAlthough regulations require producers to take responsibility for plastic waste (Extended Producer Responsibility - EPR), implementation is complex due to the lack of adequate infrastructure for plastic collection, separation, and recycling in many regions of the country. There is a consensus that the current collection and recycling system is inefficient and requires greater investment (Gaviria Gil, 2023; WRAP, 2021).\n\nLimitations in the recycling chain:\n\nRegulations do not always comprehensively address the challenges of the recycling value chain, such as the lack of formalization of professional recyclers, which makes it difficult to integrate these actors into circular economy systems.\n\nTrade and market barriers:\n\nRegulations don’t always encourage the use of recycled materials in the manufacture of new products. Furthermore, recycled plastics often compete at a disadvantage against virgin plastics, which are cheaper due to fossil fuel subsidies and a lack of internalization of environmental costs.\n\nLack of regulatory harmonization:\n\nGaps or contradictions between national, regional, and local regulations create confusion and make it difficult to implement coherent strategies for the circular economy.\n\nLimitations on innovation and ecodesign:\n\nRegulations do not always promote the development of products designed to be reused, recycled, or composted, which limits innovation in the plastics sector.\n\nLack of control and supervision:\n\nAlthough regulations exist, they are often not effectively enforced due to the lack of capacity of environmental authorities to enforce them.\n\nResistance to change by the industry:\n\nSome companies may view regulations as an obstacle rather than an opportunity, especially if the economic benefits of adopting circular practices are unclear.\nWhile Colombia has made significant progress in creating a regulatory framework and public policies to promote the circular economy in the plastics sector, barriers remain related to implementation, the competitiveness of recycled materials, and coordination among stakeholders. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to strengthen economic incentives, improve waste management infrastructure, and promote innovation and sustainability education. Furthermore, local policies, such as those implemented in Bogotá, exemplify how concrete initiatives can be promoted to advance toward a circular economy in the plastics sector.\n\nRegulatory barriers for formal and informal recyclers\n\nThe enactment of Decree 596 of 2016, aimed at formalizing the recycling sector, highlights a significant gap between legislation and its effective implementation. Four years after its issuance, a substantial knowledge gap has emerged among informal recyclers regarding the decree’s scope and benefits. This lack of information constitutes a critical impediment to the adoption of formalization. The prevailing perception among recyclers suggests an association between formalization and the imposition of job security, compliance with labor regulations, and mandatory social security contributions. These requirements are interpreted as a financial burden, derived from allocating a significant portion of their income to paying for basic services, the benefits of which are not perceived as immediate or tangible. Recyclers’ vision focuses on maximizing their incomes, which is directly correlated with the volume, quality, and price of recyclable materials. Consequently, the perceived utility of formalization is diminished by not generating an immediate increase in income (Inclusive Recycling: Towards a Circular Economy in Colombia, 2022).\nNumerous studies have examined the origins and persistence of informal recycling in Colombia, which emerged in the 1980s as a means of subsistence for families affected by the armed conflict and social crisis. Despite the challenges, recyclers have achieved recognition and organized into associations and collection centers. However, challenges persist, such as the implementation of the formalization decree, which requires recycling organizations to comply with legal requirements and register with the Superintendency of Public Utilities within five years. (Inclusive Recycling: Towards a Circular Economy in Colombia, 2022)\nAccording to the Single Information System (SSIS), in 2019, there were 319 organizations in the collection sector representing more than 30,000 people. Bogotá has 118 registered managers with 17,296 member recyclers. Antioquia, second in the list, is Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cúcuta, Bucaramanga, and Villavicencio. 21 It is estimated that in 2010, approximately 11,560 tons of solid waste were disposed of daily in these SDFs. The country’s economic center, has 29 registered managers and 2,337 member recyclers, and Valle del Cauca has 19 registered managers and 1,590 member recyclers (Sustainable Week, 2020).\nRecyclers help compensate for deficiencies in municipal waste separation in Colombia, and in March 2013, for the first time, informal recyclers were recognized as public service providers and received payment for their work (OECD, 2014). Despite this precedent, informality remains one of the sector’s major challenges. According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, 2018), 19.9 million tons of solid waste were generated in 2016; 35% was recovered through recycling, reuse, energy cogeneration, and/or composting. Overall, the recycling rate for total waste was 8.7%, while other sources report higher rates. The difference may be due to the definition of recycling and the base used: total or unrecycled solid waste (Cifuentes et al., 2021)."

    "text": "RELEVANT ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY POLICIES IN COLOMBIA\nIn the National Circular Economy Strategy (ENEC) (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, 2019), technological innovation has been established as a relevant factor for closing cycles, and collaboration between various actors to launch new business models.\nAmong the relevant economic factors identified in the ENEC (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, 2019) are:\n\nOvercoming managerial barriers to implementing circular models. The importance of disseminating success stories on implementing circular practices, new technologies, and business models is highlighted.\nFinancing and investment: The availability of financial resources is essential for developing circular economy projects. This includes investments in recycling infrastructure, clean technologies, and more efficient industrial processes. The ENEC (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, 2019) identifies incentives “that promote both processes of change in industrial and agricultural systems, as well as the development of new business models” (p. 38). These include:\ntechnical assistance and support,\ncredit with favorable conditions,\nfinancial support such as seed capital for entrepreneurship,\ntax incentives such as those provided by the Financing Law for investments in energy efficiency, and\nregulations, such as those established in Decree 1054 of 2019, which promotes investment in research, development and innovation in free trade zones.\nThese are group or chain processes where companies learn to collaborate in designing and developing circular economy projects, such as productive linkage and industrial symbiosis (pp 38-39).\n\nOther incentives relate to programs that promote entrepreneurship and innovation in the circular economy, or that aim to correct market failures, “such as carbon taxes on polluting products or tax exemptions for the import of cleaner technology” (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, 2019, p. 39).\nRegarding technological factors, the following are identified:\n\nInnovation and technological development: The development and adoption of new technologies that optimize resource use, improve energy efficiency, minimize waste generation, and promote the development of new substitute materials (e.g., bio-based polymers). Among the types of initiatives identified as relevant by the ENEC (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development; Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, 2019), are:\n\nWaste valuation model: In this type of initiative, users use materials discarded by another user as raw material. It includes recycling, resource utilization, and treatment technologies.\nClosing the cycle through reuse of products and materials: Processing technologies are required that facilitate the reuse of materials and allow for the characterization of the quality and volume of by-products.\nEco-design of products, containers and packaging: Seeks to “extend the useful life of materials, reduce their use and incorporate recovered materials into new products” (p. 21).\nInformation and communication technologies to support circular economy initiatives: digital tools for analyzing circular processes and identifying mechanisms for material recovery and value generation.\n\nKnowledge and technology transfer: Facilitate access to clean and sustainable technologies, especially for SMEs. Integrate technological components with new circular economy business models.\nTraining and development: Develop skills in using and maintaining new technologies that enable an efficient transition toward circular practices.\n\nLikewise, there are key technological challenges that hinder the advancement of the circular economy in the Colombian plastics sector:\n\nResistance to change and lack of technological training: There is a consensus on the productive sector’s resistance to implementing new technologies, which is attributed mainly to high initial costs and the lack of specialized training (Ortiz et al., 2022; Rodrigo-Ilarri et al., 2021).\nLimitations of recycling as a sole strategy: Authors such as Zapata Bravo et al. (2021) and Cifuentes et al. (2021) agree that recycling alone is insufficient to achieve a circular economy, and emphasize the need to complement it with innovation in eco-design and reuse.\nLack of technologies for tracking and monitoring materials: Gaviria Gil (2023; Ellen Macarthur Foundation) identified a lack of standardization in recycling processes and the absence of technologies that allow efficient monitoring of materials’ life cycles.\n\nThe authors present diverse perspectives regarding the speed of technological adoption, the efficiency of economic incentives, and the focus on emerging technologies versus traditional solutions:\n\nEmphasis on ecodesign: Vera-Acevedo & Raufllet (2022) emphasize that ecodesign is an area that requires greater attention, proposing the integration of life cycle analysis into product development. On the other hand, Cifuentes et al. (2021) argue that, without regulatory incentives, voluntary adoption of these practices by companies is unlikely.\nImpact of planned obsolescence: Moreno Rocha & Santamaría Jotty (2022) highlight that manufacturing short-lived products is a significant obstacle to the circular economy. In contrast, González (2021) suggests that strengthening extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies is the most appropriate solution.\nInfrastructure in rural vs. urban areas: Rodrigo-Ilarri et al. (2021) note that rural areas face greater challenges due to a shortage of collection and sorting centers. However, Ortiz et al. (2022) argue that even in urban areas, problems persist due to a lack of coordination between government and private entities.\n\nThe Colombian plastics sector faces significant technological challenges in moving toward a circular economy. Recycling and waste processing infrastructure is insufficient, limiting the ability to close production cycles. Furthermore, there is a technological gap between large companies and SMEs, with the latter lacking the resources to implement circular processes. Low investment in research and development (R&D) impedes the development of new technologies and sustainable materials. Finally, resistance to change and a lack of specialized training hinder the adoption of circular practices. Overcoming these weaknesses requires greater investment in infrastructure and technology and training and awareness programs to foster the adoption of the circular economy throughout the sector.\nOn the other hand, according to Acoplásticos, investments to expand capacity and modernize equipment in the plastics industry continue to show favorable dynamics through 2024. Imports of machinery, parts, and molds for transforming plastic materials totaled US$86 million in 2020, US$104 million in 2021, US$143 million in 2022, and US$137 million in 2023. Between January and May of this year, investments in the sector reached US$52.3 million. Of this figure, the 41.4% and 73.4% increases in purchases of blow molding and vacuum molding machines, and thermoforming machinery stand out (ValoraAnalitic, August 2024).\nREFERENCES\nACOPLÁSTICOS “Acoplásticos joins the signing of the Pact on Plastics and Single-Use Elements led by MinAmbiente.” https://acoplasticos.org/2023/10/19/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur/\nAcoplásticos (2024) Plastics in Colombia 2024, Bogotá DC Available at https://acoplasticos.org/2024/09/12/plasticos-en-colombia-2024/\nANDI (2024).

If consortium partners present different criteria, therefore conflict resolution policies shall be applied following the protocol as follows:\n\nIn case of conflict, dialogue takes place with the work package leader and the institution. If necessary, the case will be presented to the project coordinator.\nIf the conflict resolution is not in the hands of the project coordinator, the case will be presented to the quality committee. The quality committee will make decisions based on a simple majority (3 of 4 members), and each institution has one vote.\nThe quality committee can decide to open the space for resolution, calling an extraordinary assembly of all members and requesting arbitration or advice from the External Advisory Board.\n\nAny difference resulting from this plan’s interpretation or application will be resolved by direct negotiation between the parties. At any time, a consortium partner may propose, by formal communication, to the quality committee its modification.\nThe quality committee will decide in the closest ordinary session whether or not to approve the requested modification. Any modification must be framed within the objectives and results established in the project, Grant Agreement, and general guidelines of the Capacity Building in the field of higher education 2025 of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency –EACEA-."
