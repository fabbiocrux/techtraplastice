# TechTraPlastiCE Project {.tema-naranja .center}

## Consortium {.naranja background-image="figures/Consorcio.png" background-size="30%" background-position="90% 50%"}

![](figures/Consorcio-flags.png)

üèõÔ∏è 9 Higher Education Institutions | 1 Association <br>
‚è≥ Feb. 2025 - Jan. 2028 <br>
‚Ç¨ 799.887 Euros



## Main Goal {.naranja}


üéØ The main goal is to **reinforce the applied research and technological transfer capacities of the universities** improving their services portfolios to strengthen the plastic industry's contribution to the green transition.


<br><br>

üß©üß© The ambition is to foster the **collaboration and partnerships of the University with socio-economic stakeholders** to incubate, establish and develop circular initiatives, demonstrating operational success by carrying out joint recycling interventions integrating actors in the plastics value chain in Colombia, Argentina, and Chile.

## Specific Goals {.naranja}

- SO1: To identify and understand key barriers and leverage points of the local plastic companies to generate university-industry collaboration opportunities.

- SO2: Create and implement services and solutions portfolios for the plastics value chain based on the university's core competencies and knowledge. 

- SO3: Encourage multi-actor initiatives to enhance the reuse of plastic involving waste pickers organizations, companies and the local public sectors, taking advantage of the University's articulation capacities. 

- SO4: Develop recommendations on new technologies, business models, and organizational setups for university-industry collaborations based on the lessons learned from the implemented projects as a tool to improve, scale up and transfer good practices in HEIs in Latin America.
