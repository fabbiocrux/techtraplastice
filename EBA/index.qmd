# TechTraPlastiCE Project {.tema-naranja .center}

## Consortium {.naranja background-image="figures/Consorcio.png" background-size="30%" background-position="90% 50%"}

![](figures/Consorcio-flags.png)

üèõÔ∏è 9 Higher Education Institutions | 1 Association <br>
‚è≥ Feb. 2025 - Jan. 2028 <br>
‚Ç¨ 799.887 Euros



## Main Goal {.naranja}


üéØ The main goal is to **reinforce the applied research and technological transfer capacities of the universities** improving their services portfolios to strengthen the plastic industry's contribution to the green transition.


<br><br>

üß©üß© The ambition is to foster the **collaboration and partnerships of the University with socio-economic stakeholders** to incubate, establish and develop circular initiatives, demonstrating operational success by carrying out joint recycling interventions integrating actors in the plastics value chain in Colombia, Argentina, and Chile.

## Specific Goals {.naranja}

- SO1: To identify and understand key barriers and leverage points of the local plastic companies to generate university-industry collaboration opportunities.

- SO2: Create and implement services and solutions portfolios for the plastics value chain based on the university's core competencies and knowledge. 

- SO3: Encourage multi-actor initiatives to enhance the reuse of plastic involving waste pickers organizations, companies and the local public sectors, taking advantage of the University's articulation capacities. 

- SO4: Develop recommendations on new technologies, business models, and organizational setups for university-industry collaborations based on the lessons learned from the implemented projects as a tool to improve, scale up and transfer good practices in HEIs in Latin America.

**Objective**:

>The main objective of the EAB is **to provide independent, strategic advice** to the project consortium based on the intermediary results, thereby enhancing the overall scientific and societal impact of the initiative.


## Composition

Members of the EAB will be selected for their expertise and professional standing in areas directly relevant to the core objectives of the project. Particular focus will be placed on:

1. **Technological transfer and academia-industry collaboration** : experts in these competences will TechTraPlastiCE consortium to adquire effective knowledge onthe different transfer mechanisms and partnerships and their limitations. This is important in the sscope of the project.

2. **Circular economy within the plastic value chain**: experts in cricular economy could bring to the consortium examples of sustainable practices, lifecycle thinking, and resource efficiency where the academia can collaborate with the socio-economical actors. 

3. **Integration of marginalized actors in the plastic value chain into academic and research ecosystems** : 
experts in this topic can illustrated the consortium, and more particular the latinamerican context, the relevant role of  inclusivity, equity, and capacity building for underrepresented communities in the circular economy. This is a major competence where the shared of experiences will have a major impact inside and outside of the consortium.
