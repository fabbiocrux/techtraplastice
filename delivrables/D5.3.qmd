## Content creation and dissemination

The TechTraPlastiCE website will be *updated on a monthly basis* to ensure that all information remains current and relevant.
The WP5 leader is responsible for designing, administering, and maintaining the website, in close collaboration with all project partners.  

To coordinate content production, a monthly dissemination calendar (see Figure @fig-calendar) has been established. This calendar defines the contributions expected from each partner for the **News** and **Agenda** sections, thereby ensuring regular and balanced updates across the consortium.

![Calendar for dissemination contents](figures/5.3/Calendar.png){#fig-calendar fig-align="center" width="90%"}

To facilitate the preparation of dissemination materials, **standardized templates** have been provided to all partners (see Section @sec-template). These templates define the expected content format, specify the required information fields, and outline the **image format and usage rights** to ensure compliance with copyright and communication guidelines.


### Multi-Level Dissemination and Partner Engagement

In line with the EACEA’s principle of knowledge sharing, the most significant project deliverables and outputs will be made publicly available on the project website once finalized, ensuring open and easy access to key results and resources.

As illustrated in @fig-vis2, the main objective is to enable each partner institution to disseminate project outcomes at **local**, **national**, and **international** levels, according to their specific networks and outreach capacity.

![Visibility](figures/5.3/Visibility-2.png){#fig-vis2 fig-align="center" width="40%"}

- **Local level:** Refers to the internal audiences within each Higher Education Institution (HEIs) population — including students, researchers, and academic staff.  
  Dissemination at this level aims to identify and strengthen local competences within the HEIs, thereby enhancing their institutional capacity and expanding their educational and innovation portfolio in the field of circular economy.

- **National level:** Encompasses outreach to enterprises, chambers of commerce, professional associations, and other relevant actors of the plastic value chain.  
  Dissemination activities at this scale allow project results to reach stakeholders who can directly benefit from or contribute to the practical implementation of the project’s outcomes.

- **International level:** Involves participation in scientific conferences, publications, and academic collaborations that arise from the collective work of the consortium.  
  Although TechTraPlastiCE is primarily a capacity-building project, it also contributes to the broader research agenda on the circular economy transition in the plastics sector, a topic of growing societal and scientific relevance.

To effectively coordinate these multi-level dissemination activities, the WP5 leader maintains a monitoring database (see @fig-vis3).  
This tool allows for systematic tracking of the content generated and shared by each partner, ensuring balanced contributions and identifying opportunities to leverage each HEI’s local and national networks for maximum dissemination impact.
