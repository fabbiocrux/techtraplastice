# Introduction

With the coordination of *Université de Lorraine (UL – P1)* and the active collaboration of all project partners, the *Universidad Nacional de Río Negro (UNRN – P3)* leads Work Package 5 (WP5) – Dissemination and Communication within the TechTraPlastiCE project. 
This work package plays a strategic role in ensuring that the project’s objectives, activities, and results are effectively communicated to a wide range of stakeholders at local, national, and international levels.

WP5 accompanies the entire project lifecycle and is designed to maximize visibility and impact through a comprehensive dissemination strategy. It encompasses five core deliverables:

- the Digital Communication Strategy (D5.1),
- the Branding Toolkit and Training Plan (D5.2),
- the Project Website and Social Media Accounts (D5.3),
- the Open Digital Repository (D5.4), and
- the Final Conference and Results Summary (D5.5).

This report presents **Deliverable D5.3 - Project Website and Social Media accounts**, focused on the design, structure, and deployment of the official project website (techtraplastice.eu) and the associated social media platforms (@techtraplastice on LinkedIn, X, and YouTube). 

These digital tools function as the main communication and interaction channels for the project, providing a central space where stakeholders can access official updates, activities, and results. Furthermore, the project's Dissemination Plan (D5.1) includes guidelines for amplifying outreach through the social media networks of partner institutions—particularly in channels where the project does not maintain a dedicated presence, such as Facebook and Instagram. 
This integrated communication strategy is fundamental to fostering engagement and ensuring the long-term sustainability and accessibility of the project’s outputs.


# Dissemination and Exploitation within the TECHTRAPLASTICE Project


As it was developed on the project's Dissemination and Exploitation Plan (D5.1),  effective dissemination is about delivering the right message to the right person. 
Relevant stakeholders will be continuously provided with updated information regarding project activities, news and events. 

All results will be solely promoted among the partners’ national and international networks. 

On the other hand, *exploitation* also refers to transferring the project’s results after its completion and providing main target groups with tools and information to expand the impact of such results. 

At the end, final outputs materials will be shared with the open public (OERs) - D5.4 and D5.5.

## Dissemination and Exploitation channels

In order to delivering the right message to the right person,  the project's Dissemination and Exploitation Plan contemplates differents channels: 

1. Project website, 
1. social media profiles,
1. Newsletters, email,  brochures, press releases and events.
1. Open Digital Repository (c.f.  D5.4), 


In the following sections


### Project Website [techtraplastice.eu/](https://techtraplastice.eu/)


![Project Website: [https://techtraplastice.eu/](https://techtraplastice.eu/)](figures/5.3/website-00.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}


Te project website is the main platform of the project, as it is the only one to have the most clearly structured, complete and updated public information of the project for the broad public and all target groups.

The website will be actively cross-linked with other websites and platforms which add value to the TechTraPlastiCE dissemination. 
Further, the website includes a contact form in order to give the possibility to get in contact with the consortium whenever needed. 
All communication actions should lead to the website for more information and to contact the project management. 


The website will be updated on a monthly basis. 
WP5 leader will be in charge of designing, administering and keeping updated the TechTraPlastiCE website with the collaboration of all the partners. 
To this aim, a mensual calendar (See @fig-calendar) was shared to define the content generation by each partner for NEWS and AGENDA sections for dissemination purposes. 

![Calendar for dissemination contents](figures/5.3/Calendar.png){#fig-calendar fig-align="center" width="90%"}

Further, given the fact that EACEA follows the concept of knowledge sharing, the most important content deliverables of the project will be uploaded after completion on the website to guarantee easy access.

Templates were provided to send the content as it is expected (see @sec-template), including all the kind of information needed and the requirements of the image format with the corresponding assignment of image using rights.




This Plan also considers each partner’s institutional website as channels of communication, as they will replicate content (news and events) and will also have a visible and direct link to the main website of the Project on a permanent section.

All the publications -on the project’s website and on institutional websites related to the project- will be registered - by the leader of package 5 in the first case and by the corresponding partner in the second case - in a shared database for reporting purposes.

### Website tree structure and components

A first version of the TechTraPlastiCE website was created in February 2025 for the kick off meeting.
It was completed in June 2025 with all sections and functionalities required for the initial stage of the project.
The final version of the project will be ready towards the end of the project, with the section corresponding to the Open Digital Repository (D5.4) where the results of this initiative 

![TechTraPlastiCE Website structuration](figures/5.3/Arbol.pdf){#fig-home fig-align="center" width="90%"}


The TechTraPlastiCE project website is organized into a clear and accessible structure that communicates the scope, goals, and progress of the initiative. 
The layout is divided into several core sections: Home, Project, Partners, News, Agenda, and Contact, with each fulfilling a specific communication role.

The *HOME* (@fig-home) section serves as the landing page and includes a banner showcasing the project title and an engaging visual background to capture the visitor’s attention. 
This area sets the tone for the site, inviting users to explore further. 
The section highlights recent news items, with images and links to full articles, showcasing ongoing progress, events, and developments within the project.
Also, upcoming activities are presented under "Agenda", listing key dates, event titles, locations, and short descriptions to engage users and promote participation.
Below, visitors are introduced to the full description of the TechTraPlastiCE consortium.


At the *Project* section (Figure \ref{fig-project}), 
the main goal is to outline the project’s description, objective and results related to plastic circularity and sustainable innovation. 
The main activities are  detailed here, providing an overview of how the project intends to achieve its goals.

  \caption{Project section of TechTraPlastiCE website \label{fig-project}}
\end{wrapfigure}

A significant feature of this section is the breakdown by work packages (WP1 to WP6). 
Each work package is presented with a description of its tasks, roles of participating institutions, and specific goals. This breakdown helps to demonstrate the project’s strategic planning and operational roadmap.

On the other hand, the *PARTNERS* section emphasizes the collaborative nature of TechTraPlastiCE. 
It features a global map indicating the countries where partner institutions are based, visually conveying the project’s international scope.
A gallery of logos displays the institutions involved, and each is linked to external websites or profiles, providing visitors with further information about the consortium.

The *NEWS* section (@fig-news) compiles all project-related publications in a chronological list.
Each entry includes the title, date, a featured image, and a “Read more” button, allowing users to follow project milestones and access detailed updates. This section helps demonstrate transparency, dissemination of results, and community outreach.

![TechTraPlastiCE Website structuration](figures/5.3/website-02.png){#fig-news fig-align="center" width="60%"}

In the *AGENDA* section, users can find a calendar of relevant events.
Each listing provides comprehensive details such as the event name, description, date, location, and direct links to add the event to personal calendars (e.g., Google Calendar). 
This encourages active participation from stakeholders and the general public.


The *CONTACT* section includes a contact form where users can submit inquiries by filling in their name, email, subject, and message. Additionally, a direct email address [info@techtraplastice.eu](mailto:info@techtraplastice.eu) is provided for more direct communication. 

**This is very important in order to identify the enterprises that want to be part of the project in Colombia, Chile and Argentina contexts**

The footer across the site contains essential elements such as legal text, EU funding disclaimers, and quick access to social media channels.

Overall, the TechTraPlastiCE website tree reflects a well-organized, user-friendly interface that supports communication, transparency, and collaboration within a major European research initiative.

### User Experience Report (UX/UI)

The TechTraPlastiCE website features a clean and professional design that aligns with the academic and technological nature of the project as illustrated in  @fig-ux. 

Its visual identity has been developed to reflect the standards commonly associated with European research initiatives, prioritizing clarity, reliability, and institutional presence. The overall aesthetic avoids unnecessary ornamentation or visual clutter, favoring a minimalist and structured layout that enhances user experience. The site’s design serves not only as a visual representation of the project’s credibility but also as a practical tool for communication and dissemination. This thoughtful approach ensures that the content is easily accessible to a wide audience, including researchers, partners, policymakers, and the general public. Every element on the website contributes to a sense of coherence and professionalism, reinforcing the project's role within the broader European research and innovation landscape.

![TechTraPlastiCE legibility](figures/5.3/ux.png){#fig-ux fig-align="center" width="80%"}

A key component of the site’s identity is its color palette, defined in Deliverable D5.1, which is dominated by shades of blue and gray. 
These colors were chosen not only for aesthetic appeal but also for the psychological associations they carry. Blue tones evoke a sense of trust, innovation, and intelligence—values strongly aligned with scientific and technological progress—while gray adds a sense of balance, neutrality, and professionalism. 
This controlled use of color helps maintain visual harmony across the site, supporting its formal tone without being monotonous.
The palette is applied consistently throughout all sections, from banners and buttons to text highlights and backgrounds, ensuring a unified appearance. 
The result is a visual identity that is both modern and serious, which reflects the strategic goals of the project and enhances its credibility among stakeholders in the European research community.

Typography and layout are also carefully considered to promote clarity and legibility.
The font choices are clean and sans-serif, ensuring that all text remains easy to read across different devices and screen sizes.
There is no overuse of bold styles, decorative elements, or distracting graphic effects, which reinforces the project’s commitment to *functional design*. 
Content is organized into well-defined blocks, each with ample white space, making the site feel open and easy to navigate. Images and icons are used moderately and strategically to support the information, not overwhelm it.

This minimalistic and structured approach contributes to an intuitive user experience, helping users find relevant content quickly and without distraction. Overall, the website’s visual and structural design reflects a balance between aesthetic restraint and practical usability, in line with the professional and research-driven focus of TechTraPlastiCE.

#### Usability and Access to Information

The TechTraPlastiCE website intends a well-thought-out structure and user-friendly design, particularly in terms of navigation and content accessibility in **English and Spanish** given the international context as presented in @fig-consortium. A clear top menu provides direct links to the main sections—Home, Project, Partners, News, and Agenda—ensuring users can easily find key information. 

![TechTraPlastiCE in Spanish and English as international project](figures/5.3/consortium.png){#fig-consortium fig-align="center" width="80%"}

The site is responsive and functions well on mobile devices, although certain areas, such as the news modules, could benefit from improved formatting for smaller screens. 

Content is logically organized, with each section featuring concise titles, short descriptive paragraphs, and calls to action like “see more” to guide user interaction. 

On the homepage, news and events are prominently displayed, drawing attention to the latest updates and project milestones. Additionally, the site includes several useful features, such as calendar integration for events, external links to partner institutions and social media platforms, and visible contact information in the footer. 

These elements collectively contribute to a functional, accessible, and informative user experience.


#### Observations and Opportunities for Improvement

WP5 leader, with the support of the Communication Team of the project, will work in a greater presence of images or infographics that explain the project to non-technical audiences, especially in the PROJECT section. 

This will be implemented throughout the development of each working packages.

# Conclusions

The TechTraPlastiCE website and its associated digital channels successfully fulfill their primary goal of supporting communication, visibility, and knowledge sharing across all stages of the project. 
Designed under the coordination of WP5 by Universidad Nacional de Río Negro, and with the collaboration of all partners, the platform is more than an information repository—it functions as the central hub for dissemination and engagement. 
With its clean layout, multilingual accessibility, and structured sections (Home, Project, Partners, News, Agenda, and Contact), it provides targeted content to diverse audiences, from academic stakeholders to enterprises and the general public.

The integration of news, events, and contact forms ensures up-to-date information and two-way communication. Social media accounts on LinkedIn, X, and YouTube serve to amplify the project's impact by extending its reach beyond institutional circles. These channels help redirect audiences to the official website while also offering additional formats to share research outputs and project milestones.

While the current platform offers strong foundations in terms of functionality and coherence, it also presents opportunities for growth in terms of visual engagement and user interaction.
As noted, there is room to enhance the Project section through the inclusion of infographics and visual storytelling elements that better explain complex ideas to non-technical users.
Future development stages could also improve mobile optimization—particularly for the news section—and expand the content diversity shared on partner and institutional platforms. Moreover, the continued collaboration among partners in content creation, guided by shared templates and editorial calendars, will help maintain the website’s relevance and visibility. Regular updates and responsive design contribute to transparency and traceability, while the inclusion of analytics from social platforms will support performance tracking. In sum, the TechTraPlastiCE digital strategy reflects a well-structured, scalable communication framework aligned with European Commission expectations and the project’s broader objectives.
