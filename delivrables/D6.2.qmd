It also decides on overall main project issues such as strategies, corrective measures, project redirection, conflict resolution and non-performance. 


### Decision making and conflict resolution

Decision making and conflict resolution processes have the objetive to set the procedures, flows and rules based on two main principles: 


1. Voting will be based on one-vote-per-partner,
2. Decisions to be taken by each steering committee will be taken upon 6/10 of the votes.

Any signs of disagreement between project participants should be solved amicably between those partners involved. If not resolved at that level, and only if it is strictly necessary, a conflict resolution process must be enforced:

- TechTraPlastiCE participants will escalate the issue to higher management levels until resolved (form taskleader, WP Leaders and Project Coordination) and consensus to solve the problem is sought at each level.
- Eventually, if stilll not resolved, the SC will take care of the issue applying the two principles.

The Steering Committee will make proposals for such decisions to be made in the General Assembly (if needed). 

The General Assembly has to competence regarding issues impacting the overall work plan, the Grant Agreement and the Consortium Agreement. 



# Project management

It is expected that over the course of the TechTraPlastiCE project that many documents will be produced, it is therefore vital that document management processes are followed in order to enableusers to locate and identify relevant files and to ensure version control.



## Communication plan 

Clear, consistent, and transparent communication is essential for the successful coordination and implementation of the TechTraPlastiCE project. To ensure fluid internal communication and effective collaboration among all partners, the Université de Lorraine (UL), as project coordinator, will establish a shared digital platform where all relevant documents and materials will be stored and made accessible to all members of the consortium.


In addition to this platform, the project will implement monthly virtual meetings (minimum duration: 2 hours) to monitor progress, share updates, and coordinate tasks across Work Packages. 

These regular meetings will provide a structured space for reviewing advancements and addressing potential challenges collectively.
To further strengthen internal coordination, the partners have agreed on setting up a governance system, drawing on UL's extensive experience in project management. 

This system will guide the decision-making process, support the efficient execution of activities, and ensure that all voices within the consortium are heard and integrated throughout the project lifecycle.

Beyond internal communication, this project also places a strong emphasis on external communication, dissemination, and visibility, which are organized under a dedicated WP ead by the Universidad Nacional de Río Negro (UNRN). (*Please refers to the D6.1. Quality assurance plan for more details*) 

This WP is responsible for planning and executing a comprehensive strategy to promote project activities and results, maximize their impact, and ensure the visibility of the project. 

The overarching objective is to make the outcomes accessible and relevant to a wide range of audiences, well beyond the partner institutions and associated stakeholders.
The communication will be supported by a communication team composed by at least one person responsible for each partner. 
This team will be responsible for creating content, reviewing and approving dissemination materials. Additionally, the stakeholders will be continuously provided with updated information regarding project activities, news and events, thus the dissemination will have four levels: 

- **Institutional level**: To create awareness and branding influence within each university community (leaders, administrators, professors, researchers, students, etc.)
- **Socio-economic actors**: It refers to companies leaders, leaders of associations of waste-pickers, local public authorities interested in sustainability, plastics and circular economy, and the society at
large.
- **Consortium**: Targeting all European and Latin-American partners
- **International/Regional level**: To impact other non-partners, universities, associations or organizations interested in the project's objectives at international and regional level.

Face-to-face  meeting are a combination of management meeting (steering committee) and training sessions.  
The meetings are described description of action and are budgeted for each partner in the project budget. 

Regarding the online meetings, should be programmed at least a week in advance and should follow a set agenda.
Online meetings are planned periodically, the video of online meetings will be recorded and published in the project platform available to partners.
To hold online meetings, the TEAMS plateform are generally used.
Minutes of the meeting (PPT slides) will be available in the Google drive plateform.

Telephone is used when personal interaction, a fast answer or reliable confirmation is needed.
Telephone calls can sometimes be appropriate for urgent matters so it is important that up to datetelephone numbers are made available. 
It is highly recommended to send an e-mail with the conclusion of a telephone call to limit any ambiguity.

Refer to **Deliverable 6.1 Quality assurance plan**, for more details of internal communication.

## Document management

Document templates have been produced which use a standard format including defined styles,page layout and content structure. 

To ensure consistency in the TechtraPlastic project when communicating with external stakeholders or interested parties, a set of standard templates for various communications activities has been developed. 
These templates include:

- Deliverable template standard 
- Meeting Minutes (MS Word format)
- PowerPoint presentation template
- Standard logos for the project.


These templates may be updated as the project progresses and may be redesigned to fit with the design style of the project logo.Therefore,consortium partners should always use the most up-to-date version.

## Deliverables

Each deliverable should follow a set structure as set out in the templates of:

1. **Executive summary**: a brief description of the key points of the main document
2. **Table of Contents**
3. **Introduction**: an outline of the aims and objectives of the deliverable andwhere it fits in the context of the TechTraPlastiCE project. The introduction should also explain the interdependences related to this deliverable, whether thiswork is drawing on earlier tasks and deliverables and what other tasks will usethis deliverable as input or for structuring their work.• 
4. **Main body of the report**: this section will explain the task that was carried outand the results generated and illustrate the technical and scientific progress madewithin the task.
5. **Conclusions**: this section should be a summary of the major outputs of thedeliverable and potential implications of the results on other parts of the project. The conclusions should also highlight where future improvements or further workshould be directed.
6. **References**
7. **Annexes**: Annexes of data or further information not suitable for the mainbody of the report, either due to its detailed nature or separated forconfidentiality purposes.

## Tracking of deliverables

Deliverables are listed in the Grant Agreement Annex1 Part A – List of deliverables. 

Deliverables will be tracked by the project coordination, identifying deliverables due in the near future, the deadlines for each deliverable, follow-up actions and the names of the persons producing and reviewing. 

The deliverables will be uploaded to Funding & Tenders Portal Continuous Reporting tool.

## Quality managment

The quality assurance process will be grounded in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, drawing from feedback and data shared by all project partners and relevant stakeholders. Key quality criteria include:

- Relevance: The alignment of objectives with the strategic needs and priorities of the partners.
- Effectiveness: The extent to which outputs contribute to the intended outcomes.
- Pertinence: The efficiency and appropriateness of resource use in achieving deliverables in a cost-effective and timely way.
- Collaboration and Communication: The strength of coordination and transparency among consortium members, including the adequacy of communication tools and practices.
- Continuous Improvement: The presence of feedback mechanisms and iterative evaluations that allow the consortium to adapt and optimize practices throughout the project lifecycle.

This comprehensive approach will support not only the delivery of high-quality outputs but also a culture of shared responsibility, learning, and excellence among all project participants.
For more information please refer to the **Deliverable 6.1 Quality assurance
plan**. 

## Project Reporting and Reviews

According to the Grant Agreement, the project is divided into two reporting periods:

- Mid-term report: from project month 1 (Feb 2025) to project month 18 (August 2026);
- Final report: from project month 19 (Sept 2027) to project month 36 (Jan 2028).


To ensure a timely delivery of the reports, the project coordination will prepare the templates and notify the partners of their duties and where they should contribute to the report, at least 2 calendar months before the end of the reporting period. 

The project coordination will then ask that each Partner contributes to the report, reporting on their participation with work package leaders also reporting on the progress made within their work package.

The Period 1 mid-project review will include both technical reports and financial statements, as described in the grant agreement, with the following documents:

A ‘periodic technical report’ containing:

- A resumé of the TechTraPlastiCE project
- Deliverables which are due within the Period 1 reporting period, according to the Grant Agreement Annex 1 Part A – List of deliverables.
- Periodic Activity Report on the results and achievements of the project overthis reporting period, including the progress made on tasks, deliverables andachievement of milestones. If any deviations have occurred from the Description of Action in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement, an explanation justifying the differences must also be provided. 
- The Periodic Activity Report will also include a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results.
- Individual financial statements of each partner and a consolidated financial statement.
- Explanation of the use of resources
- Issues related to the action implementation and the economic and societal impact.


The Period 2 end-of-project review will include the same documents as Period 1, but applied to the whole project. 
In addition, it will include:

- A publishable summary report of all of the results, conclusions and the impact of the project, the benefits to end-users and society
- A final technical report
- An update to the exploitation plan for the implementation and disseminationof the products of the project
- Certificate of the Financial Statement (CFS) provided by auditor if necessary.




## Risk Management Approach


Effective risk management is essential to ensure the success and continuity of the TechTraPlastiCE project.  
The main categories of potential risks are:

- **Technical:** Insufficient expertise to address unexpected challenges.
- **Financial:** Economic difficulties faced by a partner, leading to a halt or significant reduction in their activities.
- **Key resources:** Withdrawal of personnel with critical roles from the project.

The most probable and highest-impact risks have been integrated into the project’s logical framework as illustrated in @tbl-risk. 

This ensures that assigned risk task leaders can take timely action to implement mitigation measures. The risk assessment framework will be reviewed and updated regularly to maintain the project’s resilience and adaptability to emerging challenges.  


@tbl-risk presents risk register outlines the main potential risks identified across the different WP.

:::


From the outset, every effort will be made to identify risks early and implement suitable mitigation strategies:  

- **Technical risks:** Rely primarily on the internal expertise of the TechTraplastiCE consortium.
- **Financial or resource-related risks:**  
  - If a partner faces financial difficulties or resource shortages, corrective measures may include reallocating the unfinished work to other partners, subcontracting it to a third party, or using a combination of both.  
  - The chosen approach will be based on an assessment of its impact and relevance to the project.  
  - Each work package (WP) leader will have a designated backup leader to ensure continuity if the original leader becomes unavailable.  


At the project’s conclusion, the project manager will:

1. Evaluate each identified risk and the overall risk management process.
2. Identify potential improvements to the process.
3. Document these improvements in the lessons-learned knowledge base for use in future projects.


### Change management plan  

Based on the risk analysis, to ensure structured and transparent change management throughout the project, the following steps will be followed:

- **Identification**: Any project partner identifying the need for a change will initiate the process by documenting the nature and justification of the proposed change.
- **Submission** : The person requesting the change will formally submit the request via email to the project coordination, including relevant details and rationale.
- **Evaluation**: The Project coordination, in collaboration with the Steering Committee (SC), will assess the potential impact of the change on the project’s cost, risk, schedule, and scope.
- **Decision**:  The Steering Committee will review the proposed change and all supporting information to make a final decision on whether the change will be approved.
- **Implementation**: If approved, the Project Manager will implement the change, update and re-baseline all relevant project documentation, and ensure that the change is effectively communicated to all team members and stakeholders.




## Project closure

The project's expected outcomes, including the development of a holistic framework, capacity building for universities, implementation of progressive technology transfer services, pilot projects, creation of an open-source repository, and policy recommendations, contribute to sustainable strategies. 
Each outcome serves to enhance the project's long-term impact and ensure its continued success beyond the funding period, crucial for maximizing its benefits.

At the project's conclusion, a comprehensive impact assessment will be conducted to evaluate outcomes, lessons learned, and areas for improvement. 
Comprehensive documentation of project processes, methodologies, and results will be undertaken to create a handbook guiding future initiatives.
Knowledge transfer sessions and training programs will be facilitated for key stakeholders to retain expertise gained during the project. 
Efforts will also focus on exploring and securing additional funding sources, including follow-up grants, industry partnerships, or private investments. 

Priority will be given to ongoing capacity building for project team members to keep them abreast of the latest developments in their respective fields. 
Successful project outcomes will be seamlessly integrated into existing institutional structures or processes to embed the project's impact in the organization's long-term strategy. A final meeting, held in Bariloche, will disseminate the project's main results to a large target community of actors involving partner universities, other non-partner companies, waste-pickers, and local government. 





# Financial management plan	

As specified in the Consortium Agreement, the financial contribution of the Funding Authority to the
TechTraPlastiCE project is distributed by the Project Coordinator. according to 

- the consortium agreement;
- the approval of reports by the Funding Authority.


The project Coordinator commits to carrying out payments relating to the subject matter of the contract to the partners  receiving the funds by the EACEA, according to the achievement of the tasks and the following schedule: 

   - 1st payment: the Coordinator must transfer the pre-financement payment to the Partners within 30 days following the reception of the funds from the EACEA, which should correspond to 70 % of the maximum grant amount attributed to each Partner, as set on the Grant Agreement n° 101179564 and its annexes. 
   - Final payment: the payment of the balance, up to 30 %, shall be made by the Coordinator to the Partners within 30 days following the reception of the funds from the EACEA, at the end of the project. This payment is made by the EACEA once the partner’s contractual agreements have been fully met and all the necessary supporting documentation has been received and validated in the final report of the project. The beneficiary reserves the right to withhold the balance and demand a refund of the amounts already paid if the report is presented after the deadline mentioned in article 9 of the consortium agreement.

All payments shall be regarded as advances pending explicit approval by the EACEA of the final report including approval of the eligibility of the activities, the corresponding cost statement (if applicable) and the assessment of the quality of the results of the project. 

The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float. It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
The funds made available shall be exclusively spent for the implementation of the project.



The budget allocation to each partner is based on the specific activities they are responsible for within the project. 
Each partner has been allocated a minimum number of person-months to participate effectively in project actions. 
This approach ensures that all members have the necessary resources to fully engage and contribute to the project's success.




##  Expenditure control

The objective of applying cost management is to ensure that the project is completed within budget.
Expendure control refers to the process of gathering, tracking and managing the financial resourcesthroughout the project’s life cycle. 
This process relies heavily on accurate estimates and actual data that need to be maintained and updated accordingly. 
Having quality input data is the key to obtaining reliable cost information for managing resources and making decisions. 
Cost summaries information at the different levels are rolled up from task level to the project level.

In order to keep track of the estimated and real budget spent by each partner, the PM requests a financial internal report every year, where real personnel costs, other direct costs and indirect
costs during the period are indicated. 
The control and management of the financial resources allocated to each institution will be the sole responsibility of the affiliated universities. 

Each university will handle its internal costs in accordance with its own institutional rules and procedures. 
At the end of each defined reporting period, they will prepare a detailed financial report to be submitted to the Project Coordinator for consolidation and verification. 

Furthermore, during each audit, the universities will be required to present full and transparent accounts regarding the use of their allocated funds. 
Additionally, to ensure proper tracking and accountability of the spending, each partner will be responsible for regularly completing the table presented in @sec-financial, detailing the expenses incurred by their institution.


## Procurement management plan 

All procurement activities will be conducted in accordance with the Grant Agreement and the guidelines for the use of the grant. 

The Project Manager will provide overall oversight and coordination of procurement procedures across the project. However, each affiliated university will carry out its procurement processes following its own institutional rules and national regulations. 
During each audit, procurement documentation must be presented in line with the internal templates and reporting standards of each institution, ensuring traceability and compliance.


Equipment for the pilot's implementation was established to the 7 Latin American Universities that will be leading the implementation of recycling initiatives. 
Embracing open source technology solutions (hardware/software) to reduce administrative overheads and to possibly adapt to the context was a strategy adopted to improve the resources. 

Scientific equipment and open source hardware for developing the recycling initiative were envisioned as a major strategy to guarantee the cost efficiency of the project. The equipment per country will be purchased from a single supplier, ensuring a lower value per volume. In addition, the guidelines of the institution will be followed to call for tenders with a minimum of 3 suppliers to ensure the best value for money.

# Conclusions

The Financial and technical management plan is a central, living document that guides the execution, monitoring, and quality assurance of the TechTraPlastiCE project. It ensures alignment with the agreed work plan, provides mechanisms for effective internal and external communication, and establishes processes for risk management, quality control, and decision-making.

As the project evolves, the PMP will be periodically updated to reflect new insights, operational adjustments, and lessons learned. This iterative approach will enable the consortium to maintain high performance standards, adapt to emerging challenges, and strengthen collaborative practices.

Ultimately, the PMP’s structured methodology and continuous improvement framework will support the achievement of the project’s strategic objectives, ensuring that the outcomes deliver lasting value for higher education institutions, industry stakeholders, and the wider community engaged in advancing circular economy value chains for plastics in Latin America.
