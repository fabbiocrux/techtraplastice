# Introduction

The TechTraPlastiCE project aims to strengthen the capacities of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Colombia, Argentina, and Chile to identify and activate key leverage points that can accelerate the transition toward a Circular Economy within the industrial plastic value chain.
These leverage points include the identification and development of high-impact opportunities — whether pedagogical, research-oriented, technology transfer-related, or focused on dissemination—where HEIs can play a central role in close collaboration with local socio-economic stakeholders.

The overarching goal of the project is to foster innovation by addressing circularity gaps in local ecosystems, thereby building trust and enhancing collaboration between universities and industry. To achieve this, the project has established a comprehensive and structured quality management framework, designed to:

- Uphold the integrity, reliability, and responsiveness of all project activities.
- Promote a culture of continuous improvement.
- Ensure shared accountability across all consortium partners


@fig-qmp provides an overview of the structure of the quality management plan.

![Overview of the quality management plan.](figures/6.1/Quality-management-plan.png){#fig-qmp width="60%"}



The quality system framework of the project is built around three key components:

1. **Project Quality Committee**: it is responsible for guarateeing the deliverances of the outputs of the project. 
The Université de Lorraine (UL), in collaboration with selected partners will establish a quality committee that validates the criteria, indicators, and procedures to guide the project’s development and ensure high standards of quality.

2. **Communication Tools and Procedures**: UL will establish a shared digital platform to ensure that all relevant documents and materials are accessible to all consortium members. 
In addition, a monthly virtual meeting (minimum two hours) will be held to review progress, share updates, and coordinate upcoming tasks, fostering consistent communication and alignment across the consortium.

3. **External Advisory Committee**: An external committee, composed of independent experts, will be appointed to review and provide feedback on the project’s public deliverables and on-going tasks. 
Their role will be to strengthen external engagement and ensure that outputs meet high-quality standards, while also offering strategic advice on the project’s overall development.

The TechTraPlastiCE project is strategically structured to maximize its impact on the transition toward a Circular Economy in the Latin American industrial plastic sector. 
Therefore, the quality efforts will ensure the delivery of pertinent outcomes, support long-term capacity building, and contribute to the development of sustainable interaction of the academia with the socio-economic ecosystems. 
The following sections will provide further detail on the implementation strategies, monitoring mechanisms, and expected quality guidelines of the project.


# Project Quality Committee --PQC-

The Université de Lorraine is in charge of the coordination of the project following the Grant Agreement # 101179564 and under the delegation of the consortium members expressed through the mandates annexed to the agreement. 
In that sense, UL will lead to establish a **Project Quality Committee (PQC)** that will be at the heart of the quality assurance of the project outcomes.

This internal structure is entrusted with the revision and continuous improvement of the project quality of the deliverables of the project, and responsibilities to be adhered to throughout the project lifecycle in their tasks. 
In the following subsections, an attention will be made to the different guidelines for the PQC.



## Role and principles of the PQC

The major goals of the project quality committee regarding the different deliverables of TechTraPlastiCE project are:

1. Deliverables are designed to enhance proficiency in project management, thereby supporting more effective project execution and oversight.

2. Deliverables meet the specific requirements of project lead beneficiaries, partners representatives, the project coordinator, and ultimately, the European Union.

3. Deliverables are aligned with industry best practices in project management, ensuring quality and consistency across project outputs.

4. Deliverables are prepared for web delivery and dissemination respecting the visual identity requirements (cf. Deliverable 5.2), with the exception of those classified as confidential. 

5. Deliverables are clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly. They provide all necessary information required by Partners to effectively progress in relevant tasks, minimizing the need for additional clarification, integration requests, or supplementary data.

<!-- 6. Project management practices conform to the Project Management Plan** (Deliverable D6.2), ensuring alignment with approved methodologies and standards. -->


The PQC is established for the duration of the project, taking into account three main roles:

1. Validation the timely fulfillment of the tasks and obligations acquired by the partners are completed efficiently and effectively.  
2. The quality approval of the working packages' deliverables assuring that both inputs and outputs are meet based on predefined performance criteria.
3. Identification of proactive actions if particular tasks will need additional support.

<!-- 2. Oversee the execution of the working packages, assuring that both inputs and outputs meet predefined performance criteria, and that all tasks are completed efficiently and effectively. 
3. Identification of the use of resources—human, financial, and material—to guarantee optimal utilization, alerting in a preventive manner if particular tasks will need additional support.   -->

These three elements are the heart of the quality management of the project. 
Any proposed modifications to the quality plan must be formally reviewed and approved through a defined revision process, led by the PQC and finalized with the approval of the project coordinator. 

This process ensures that all changes are tracked, documented, and communicated clearly across the project team, reinforcing consistency and traceability.

For doing that, five major principles will be assured throughout the project duration in order to guarantee a pertinent quality management process:


::: {.callout-note title="Principles of TechTraPlastiCE Quality Committee"}

- **Respect**: Understood as the consideration and appreciation of the work of the other actors involved in the project, as well as respect for the environment and activities that promote its appreciation and conservation.

- **Transparency**: it specifies that any information addressed to the PQC, consortium, general public, or stakeholders of the project will be easily accessible and easy to understand, and clear language shall be used. This principle also stipulates free access to meeting minutes and always having a clear and honest response regarding decision-making mechanisms.

- **Accountability**: it assigns clear roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations to each project partner and governing body. In the TechTraPlastiCE project, each institution is held responsible for their commitments, outputs, and use of resources. Mechanisms for regular performance evaluation, issue resolution, and corrective action are integral to this principle, ensuring that all project activities are conducted with integrity and aligned with agreed standards and objectives.

- **Strategic Alignment**: it ensures that all project activities, decisions, and resource allocations are consistently guided by the project's overarching goals, priorities, and intended impacts. This principle implies that efforts remain focused, coherent, and capable of delivering measurable value throughout the project duration. 

- **Cooperation**: it emphasizes the importance of open dialogue, trust, and shared commitment among all partners of TechTraPlastiCE. It will foster a working environment where partners actively contribute to common goals, align efforts, and resolve challenges collectively ensuring that the project implementation will benefit from the collective expertise, resources, and engagement of the entire consortium.

:::

## Obligations of the PQC

The **Quality Committee** is entrusted with the following responsibilities to ensure the effective implementation and high standards of the project:

1. Assess and validate the quality and timely completion of all deliverables within each work package, ensuring full compliance with the agreed project plan. When necessary, the Committee may seek the expertise of another project partner or a member of the **External Advisory Board** if the review requires additional technical or disciplinary competencies.

<!-- **Monitoring of Project Timeline**   -->
1. Oversee adherence to deadlines and monitor the progress of activities in accordance with the established project schedule, ensuring timely delivery of all expected outcomes.

<!-- **Review and Approval of Publications**   -->
1. Identify all scientific publications, books, and other outputs resulting from project activities. This assessment will be based on compliance with the Grant Agreement (notably Article 17), alignment with the project’s values and objectives, adherence to quality standards, and proper acknowledgment of all contributors.

<!-- **Crisis Management and Mitigation**   -->
1. Identify and propose appropriate measures to mitigate risks or respond to **force majeure**[^1] events that could jeopardize the quality of deliverables or disrupt the project timeline. 
Eventually, conduct internal audits if repeated cases of non-compliance by consortium members are identified, in order to safeguard the integrity and accountability of the project.

## Members of the PCQ

The project quality committee will be composed of 4 members of the consortium of TechTraPlastiCE, two European and two from Latin-american HEI as illustrated in @fig-members.

![Members of the project quality committe of TechTraPlastiCE.](figures/6.1/PQC-00.png){#fig-members width="60%" fig-align="center"}

1. The Université de Lorraine will have a permanent position on the quality committee as coordinator of the TechTraPlastiCE project *[COORD]*. 
2. One position representing an European partners *[EU]*. 
3. One position representing Latin American partners *[LA]*.
4. A rotating position *[RO]* will be assigned according to the status of the project. Based on the timetable of the project, the partners that has the most significant relevance in the on-going phase will be invited to the committee to inform the factual development of the tasks. 
This includes advances and difficulties found to take action proactively.  

Regarding the consolidation of the members of the PQC, an open call will be made at the beginning of the project to establish the first committee.
Then, there will be an open call at *Month 18* to change the participants. 

On the other hand, regarding the [RO] position, it is suggested the following rotation as illustrated in the @tbl-rotation.
In the case that one of the participants of [EU] or [LA] takes the position as [RO], there will be an open call to the consortium in order to restructure the composition of the quality committee.
It is established that the committee will internally validate the member to be invited to the next cycle of the rotating position and agree on the interest of the declared institution in participating.

```


### Initial set-up of the PQC

An open call to all members of the consortium was made at the virtual meeting of Monday 28/04 2025, 
Thus, the initial set-up quality committee was made as follows:

1. [COORD] : Université de Lorraine --UL-: 
   - Main: *Fabio A. Cruz Sanchez*
   - Substitute: Université de Lorraine: *Catalina Suescun*. 
2. [EU] : Columbus Association --COL-
   - Main: *Kelly Henao*
   - Substitute: *Cecilia Valdés*
3. [LA] : Universidad Nacional de Rio Negro --UNRN-
   - Main: *Marian Lenchours Pezzano*
   - Substitute: *Maria Paula Awe Luca*
4. [RO] : Pontificia Universidad de Valparaiso --PUCV-:
   - Main: *Sandra Ponce*
   - Substitute: *Carlos Calesi*

Regarding the [RO] position, the Pontificia Universidad de Valparaiso - Chile was proposed initially as they will lead the WP1 in the first phase of the project.

## Procedures of the project development

![Procedure of the quality management of the TechTraPlastiCE development](figures/6.1/Procedure-PQC.png){#fig-pqc-procedure}

@fig-pqc-procedure illustrates the procedure of the development of the TechTraPlastiCE project.
Each step presents the objective expected. 

1. *Step 1*: aims that WP leaders interact with the task leaders and the coordination before the WP starts in order to define the shared language and vision for the WP.
1. *Step 2*: seeks to  task leader organize and structure the instruments to be used with th the whole consortium to the development of the tasks.
1. *Step 3*: Managers of each partner will lead the implementation of the task within its local university/ecosystem taking the support of the leader tasks.
1. *Step 4*: The participants develop the respective tasks according to the indications of task leaders.
1. *Step 5*: Managers of each university will collect, synthesize and share the results with the task leaders.
1. *Step 6*: Task leaders will formalize the set of results obtained by the consortium, validating the respective objectives and milestones.
1. *Step 7*: WP and task leaders will formalize the deliverable to be shared to the PCP and for the cross-reviewing process before submission to the EU commission. 

Based on that process, the quality committee will promote a quick and effective identification of the problems during the project. 
In that sense, it aims to co-create solutions between the parties in case of disagreements and divergence of perspectives in the project development.
If consortium partners present different criteria, therefore conflict resolution policies shall be applied following the protocol as follows:

1. In case of conflict, dialogue takes place with the work package leader and the partner' managers. If necessary, the project coordinator can participate. 
2. If the conflict resolution is not in the hands of the project coordinator, the case will be presented to the quality committee. 
The quality committee will make decisions based on a simple majority (3 of 4 members), and each member has one vote.
3. The quality committee can decide to open the space for resolution, calling an extraordinary assembly of all members and requesting arbitration of Steering committee and eventually advice from the External Advisory Board.

Any difference resulting from this plan's interpretation or application will be resolved by direct negotiation between the parties. 
At any time, a consortium partner may propose, by formal communication, to the quality committee its modification. 

The quality committee will decide in the closest ordinary session whether or not to approve the requested modification.
Any modification must be framed within the objectives and results established in the project, Grant Agreement, and general guidelines of the Capacity Building in the field of higher education 2025 of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency --EACEA-. 

## Official Meetings of the PQC

As a general rule, at least one official meeting per semester will be made in order to guarantee the advancement of the project. 
@tbl-meetings present a proposition of expected meetings that will take place during the project.
This is a first draft proposition that will evolve during the project development.
The call for sessions of the quality committee will be notify by the project coordinator at least *fifteen days* in advance. 


```{r}
#| label: tbl-meetings
#| tbl-cap: "Planification of Official Meetings of the project quality committee"

table <- read_csv("tables/D6.1/meetings.csv")

table <- 
tibble(
  Meeting =c(1:5),
  "Expected date" = c("M6", "M12", "M18", "M27", "M33"),
  "Possible Agenda" = c(
    "1) Task of WP1 and links WP1 and WP2 \n 2) Establishment of supporting task fo WP5 and WP6",
    "1) Tasks of WP2 \n 2) Connection of inputs of WP1 / WP2 for WP3",
    "1) Development of  WP3.\n 2) Intermediate Rapport",
    "1) Implementation of WP4.\n 2) Data collection from WP4 for final rapport",
    "1) Final conferences.\n 2) Public results and outputs"
    )
)



table %>%
  mutate_all(linebreak) %>%
  kbl("latex", booktabs = T, escape = F, align = c('c','c','l'),
      linesep = "\\midrule\\addlinespace") %>%
   kable_styling(full_width = F,                 
                font_size = 11) %>% 
   row_spec(0, color = "white", background = "Naranja", bold = T, font_size = 12) %>%
   column_spec(1, width = c("1.5cm"))  %>%
   column_spec(2, width = c("2cm"))  %>%
   column_spec(3, width = c("9cm"))  

```


The committee may meet in extraordinary sessions called when one of the members of the committee requires it, and after notification via email, justifying the need for the session and at least ten days in advance.

The committee will meet with a quorum of *at least three members*, and in the absence of a quorum, the committee shall be summoned again within the next 10 days. 
The leaders of the work packages will be summoned to accompany the quality committee sessions when necessary. 
The leaders of the aforementioned work packages will participate with voice, but will not have a vote in the decisions that are determined in the committee.


## Quality Guidelines

The quality guidelines of the TechTraPlastiCE project are not limited to the end results or deliverables; but rather, the purpose is to have an integral consideration across every phase of the project, from planning, execution and evaluation of each task.

In that sense, based on the timetable plan and on the Logical Framework Matrix the proposal, the quality committee will help to assess expectations, level of progress and difficulties of each task and milestones.  
Additionally, in the regular consortium planned meetings (virtual and physical), the checking progress and difficulties of the work packages will be monitored. 
Therefore, two major approaches are envisaged: 

1. The quality processes of the project are based on internal monitoring. 
2. Cross-revision of the deliverables by the consortium before submission.


### Internal monitoring

In the physical meetings planned by TechTraPlastiCE, the progress and difficulties of the work packages will be internally monitored by the project quality committee..
The quality control and monitoring processes will identify both qualitative and quantitative data collected from all project partners and key stakeholders based on specific criteria:

1. **Relevance**: Evaluate the alignment of objectives with the needs and priorities of the partners.
2. **Effectiveness**: Examine whether the project outputs are contributing to the achievement of projected outcomes and meeting its objectives.
2. **Pertinence**: Assess the relevance, usefulness, and efficiency of inputs in delivering outputs in an economical and timely manner.
3. **Collaboration and Communication**: Assessing the effectiveness of communication channels and collaboration among project partners, ensuring transparent information exchange, and fostering a cohesive working environment conducive to achieving project objectives.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Implementing mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and feedback loops to identify areas for improvement and optimize project processes, fostering a culture of continuous learning and enhancement throughout the project lifecycle.


Thus, @tbl-int.monitoring presents the guideline points to be discussed in each event.
Appropriate instruments will be structured for those sessions with the whole consortium to specify the quality of the tasks.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-int.monitoring
#| tbl-cap: "Guideline points of the PCQ at the event meetings"
#| tbl-pos: H

    )

table %>%
  mutate_all(linebreak) %>%
  kbl("latex", booktabs = T, escape = F,
      linesep = "\\midrule\\addlinespace") %>%
   kable_styling(full_width = F,                 
                font_size = 11) %>% 
   row_spec(0, color = "white", background = "Naranja", bold = T, font_size = 12) %>%
   column_spec(1, width = c("3cm"))  %>%
   column_spec(2, width = c("2cm"))  %>%
   column_spec(3, width = c("8cm"))  

```


On the other hand, the following factual elements will be used as primary sources of analysis: 

1. ***Report of the work packages leaders:*** the leaders of the work packages must give a feedback to the quality committee on the progress and execution of their activities. In each monthly meeting is expected to give time for the development of each task that is running according to the timetable of the project.
2. ***Tools and Instruments***: Response rate of the project instruments (i.e. online questionnaires / surveys, physical meetings among others)  developed by the consortium.
3. ***Interviews***: specific meetings with the task and work packages leaders in each institution.
4. ***Focus groups***: during the development of the TechTraPlastiCE project, it is intended integrate external stakeholders in particular task (i.e: search conferences, Creativity solving challenges  analysis in different meetings of the project.)
5. Other tools agreed upon by the Quality Committee.


As secondary information, the following will be used:

* Progress reports and institutional documents of the partners used for internal monitoring and quality assurance.
* Analysis of the minutes of the development of the tasks.

Based on these elements, the internal monitoring of the project will take place for the official meetings of the quality committee. 


### Working Packages Leaders and Cross-reviewing process of deliverables

TechTraPlastiCE project will implement an internal cross-reviewing of each deliverable before they are submitted to the official EU portal. 
Therefore, each partner will have a role as a reviewer.
The expected role of the cross-reviewer is to seek coherence in the content, structure, and formatting of the deliverable, ensuring alignment with the project objectives, work package descriptions, and EU guidelines.
Reviewers will verify the accuracy of technical information, clarity of language, and consistency across sections. 
Feedback will be provided in a timely manner using a standardized review template to ensure a harmonized approach across all partners using the format in the @sec-cross. 


Thus, it is the responsibility of the Work Package Leader to coordinate the delivery dates, results, and established activities, and ensuring the quality of the deliverables in charge of others involved in the work package activities. 
Consequently, it is the responsibility of the deliverables leader to planify, prepare and develop the respective document for WP leader.

The WP leaders must send the final version of the documents of their package to the Quality Committee and the specific partner designed for the internal reviewing according to @tbl-int.cross. 
In the event of any delay, it is possible to write to the project coordinator explaining the reasons. 
The project coordination can grant an extra delay without the need to consult with the quality committee. 

The coordination will oversee the review process and ensure the incorporation of relevant feedback before final submission.
This quality management process aims to enhance the reliability, professionalism, and impact of all project outputs while fostering mutual accountability and collaboration among partners throughout the project's duration.

In the event of force majeure that makes it impossible to comply with the activities and deliverables established in the work package, the package leader must notify the project coordinator who will replicate the information to the quality committee to validate strategies that ensure the successful completion of the project.

   column_spec(4, width = c("3cm"))  %>%
   column_spec(5, width = c("3cm"), bold = TRUE,border_right = TRUE, background = "Verde")

```


Finally, the WP leaders will share to all partners around progress, results, risks, and risk mitigation proposals of the development of each deliverable at the common meetings.


# Internal and External Communications & Publications

Regarding the means of communication, the coordination will guarantee the technological infrastructure to make possible the meetings of the quality committee.
Each meeting will be documented with an action-oriented *compte rendu*, not only to a report with general information on project activities but also includes risk analysis and timely. 
The internal quality findings will be formally documented and communicated across the project governance structure providing  a quick overview and facilitates communication with partners, and facilitates the decision-making process.


## Internal communication

@tbl-int.comm presents the various methods of communication among the TechTraPlastiCE consortium. 
These communication methods provide standards for information exchange, ensuring that the participants in the task, and affected groups are informed on the appropriate aspects of project and intergroup commitments are communicated.

   column_spec(4, width = c("3cm"))

```


Day by day communication of the project related issues will be done via email/ phone.
Important communications should be traced via mail with copy to project coordinator.


## External Communication

On the other hand, regarding the external communications, all partner of the consortium must pay special attention to the general guidelines of the financing instrument "Capacity Building in the field of higher education 2025" of the EACEA of the European Community and the provisions of the Grant Agreement, in particular, what is mentioned in Article 17 on *Communication, Dissemination and Visibility*.

All members of the project, coordinating institutions, partners, consultants, and external stakeholders must be aware of these guidelines modifications and be co-responsible for the general quality of the deliverables, dissemination, internal and external meetings.

Each Partner wishing to undertake any formal communication activity/initiative related to the project should inform WP5 leader (Universidad Nacional de Rio Negro --UNRN-) as leader of dissemination activities.

The content and the overall message of the communication activities should be agreed with the WP5. 
WP5 leader should be consulted on the visual identity of the Project (logo, communication style..). 
All communication activities shall be monitored by the UNRN at latest quarterly.

## Dissemination and publication of project results

Before the dissemination and publication of project results, the partner shall give the project coordinator and all the other Project Partners at least 15-calendar-day-notice.

Other partners then have one calendar week to comment the dissemination/publication and request necessary modifications, if any.
If there are no partners comments within the period above, the dissemination/publication of results is allowed.


## Use of social media

The Project uses social media.

# External Advisory Board

A dedicated **External Advisory Board (EAB)** has been established as a core component of the TechTraPlastiCE project's quality assurance strategy. The EAB plays a dual role: ensuring the excellence of project outputs and enhancing engagement with key external stakeholders in academia, industry, and the circular economy sector.
In that sense, EAB will be established, composed of at least five high-level experts from relevant fields.
The main objective of the EAB is to provide independent, strategic advice to the project consortium based on the obtained data, thereby enhancing the overall scientific and societal impact of the initiative.

The EAB will serve as a critical interface between the TechTraPlastiCE consortium and external stakeholders, offering guidance on key issues, responding to consortium queries, and contributing to the broader dissemination and visibility of project results.
Its role will be instrumental in aligning project activities with current trends, best practices, and emerging opportunities in the field, at the European and Latin American context.

Members of the EAB will be selected for their expertise and professional standing in areas directly relevant to the core objectives of the project. 
Particular focus will be placed on:

1. **Technological transfer and academia-industry collaboration** : experts in these competences will TechTraPlastiCE consortium to acquire effective knowledge on the different transfer mechanisms and partnerships and their limitations. 
This is important in the scope of the project.

2. **Circular economy within the plastic value chain**: Experts in circular economy will provide the consortium with concrete examples of sustainable practices, lifecycle thinking, and resource‑efficiency measures, where the collaboration between academia and socio‑economic stakeholders can take place.

3. **Integration of marginalized actors in the plastic value chain into academic and research ecosystems** : 
Researchers / practitioners in this topic can illustrated the consortium, and more particular the latin-american context, the relevant role of inclusivity, equity, and capacity building for underrepresented communities in the circular economy. This is a major competence where the shared of experiences will have a major impact inside and outside of the consortium.

The EAB will work closely with the project coordinator and select members of the consortium. **Two formal meetings per year** will be coordinated by the project coordinator, although **ad hoc consultations** may occur as needed.
In addition to strategic input, EAB members will also be invited to participate in key project events, workshops, and public engagement activities, thereby contributing to increased visibility and uptake of project outcomes across multiple sectors.

By incorporating diverse perspectives and expertise, the **External Advisory Board** will play a vital role in reinforcing the relevance, inclusiveness, and long-term sustainability of TechTraPlastiCE’s results.

The EAB is presented in the official TechTraPlastiCE's website  [https://techtraplastice.eu/comite-asesor/](https://techtraplastice.eu/comite-asesor/)

## Logic of Participation of the External Board Advisory (EBA) in TechTraPlastiCE

The External Board Advisory (EBA) will play a central role in guiding the TechTraPlastiCE project throughout its lifecycle. 
The main purpose is to bring together experts in **circular economy, technology transfer between academia and industry, and plastic value chain**, to the project’s activities in order to have a external perspective aligned with both international best practices and the specific socio-economic realities of Latin America.  

The EBA’s participation is structured across key points, each corresponding to critical phases of the project, where their expertise will be most impactful.  


### Introduction Participation EBA - 2025


The purpose of 2025 for EBA will be to present the project and exchange first EBA's experiences for all consortiums in order to establish a baseline of mutual confidence.
For example, during the kickoff meeting, we had the opportunity to invite Prof. Ferran Giones[^2] of the university of Stuttgart and the Prof. Maria Jose Zapata[^3] of the University of Gothenburg.
They share with the TechTraPlastiCE consortium a presentation on "*Technology Transfer
Challenges & Opportunities*"" (Prof. Ferran Giones) and "*Circular Grassroots Innovations*" (Prof. Maria José Zapata); giving remarkable insights on grassroot innovation (Waste Pickers) in the challenges that TechTraPlastiCE aims to tackle.

[^3]: See his profile on [https://www.eni.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Giones/](https://www.eni.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Giones/)


Likewise, we introduced Prof. Astrid Jaime from the UNIMINUTO from Colombia (@fig-astrid), in the frame of the *WP2: Development of a networked portfolio* at the general meeting of October 22/2025.
She shared her experience on the development of the Technology Transfer Office at the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), giving  learned lessons of the process to the consortium. 
This was very useful to the current activities of the TechTraPlastiCE consortium. 
Therefore, the intention is to present the different members of the EAB, through general presentation of their background and experiences that match the tasks of the TechTraPlastiCE.

### I. Participation of EBA – 2026, Q1

At this stage, the consortium will have completed the **baseline assessments on circular economy practices** (WP1) across universities. Latin American Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) will also have identified their internal service portfolios and are beginning to position themselves in relation to local and regional socio-economic ecosystems.  
This is  a **foundational moment** for cross-learning and setting common grounds for collaboration.  

The task involved in this participation is the following:

- Task 2.3: *Promoting cross-peer collaboration and mentoring*  

Therefore, the EBA’s Contribution  will around :  

1. Provide feedback on how HEIs can better align their service portfolios with the needs of their local ecosystems.
2. Identify **shared barriers** across the three participating countries, highlighting systemic challenges to academia-industry collaboration.
3. Help map **specific opportunities** that each HEI can explore, considering the diversity of socio-economic contexts.


The format expected will be a joint workshop where HEIs present their findings and local challenges that may involve in-depth advisory and mentoring sessions with EBA experts to refine collaboration strategies.  



## II. Participation of EBA – 2026, Q4

By late 2026, the project will transition from **analysis to action**. This phase focuses on identifying potential collaborative initiatives and preparing for the **pilot projects** that will be launched in 2027. 
Thus, the emphasis will be on validating ideas, selecting feasible initiatives, and aligning them with circular economy objectives.  

Likewise, this participation is enframed in the tasks:

- Task 3.4: *Search Conferences*  
- Task 3.5: *Implementation of collaborative initiatives*  


In that sense, the EBA will join the TechTraPlastiCE :  

1. Give feedback  on the proposed pilot projects in terms of feasibility, innovation, and regional impact.
2. Provide recommendations to strengthen partnerships between HEIs and ecosystem actors (industry, municipalities, NGOs).
3. Anticipate potential risks and suggest strategies for effective implementation.

It is expected that EBA may join in project meetings and (if possible for EBA Colombian, Chilean and Argentinian) in-situ search conferences. 
As a result,  structured recommendations report highlighting *critical success factors* for the pilot phase.  


## III. Participation of EBA – 2027, Q2

In 2027, pilot projects will be underway. This is a **critical testing ground** where theoretical models of circular economy are confronted with **real-world socio-economic challenges**. Cross-evaluation of pilot projects will allow HEIs to learn from each other’s experiences and adapt their approaches.  

Consequently, the task involved is: 

- Task 4.1: *Cross-evaluation of pilot projects between Latin American Universities*  


For this reason, the contribution of the EBA will be: 

1. Put in perspective the **practical implementation** of circular economy initiatives across different HEIs.
2. Highlight both **positive and negative externalities** for local ecosystems.
3. Provide guidance on strengthening HEIs’ role in long-term technology transfer and ecosystem collaboration.
4. Suggest potential **funding and partnership opportunities** to sustain successful pilots beyond the project.


## IV. Participation of EBA – 2027, Q4


The final phase of the project will consolidate knowledge and experiences into **institutional recommendations**. This stage is crucial to ensure that the project’s impact extends beyond its duration, enabling HEIs to embed circular economy principles into their long-term strategies.  

The task that will be involved is

- Task 4.4: *Institutional Recommendations*

Therefore, the EBA will:  

1. Provide a **final external perspective** on the entire project journey—from portfolio co-creation to pilot testing.
2. Add contrasting viewpoints that enrich the institutional recommendations and ensure they are relevant for both academia and practice.
3. Suggest **strategic pathways** for HEIs to advance circular economy and technology transfer initiatives after the project’s completion.


The add value of EBA in this point of the project is to extract **transferable best practices** according to their experience to the HEI's, not only from TechTraPlastiCE, but for latin-american HEI's.
This will contribute to the final recommendations report and eventually working for  post-project sustainability strategies.  



# Conclusions

This document reports a quality plan that will be implemented in the TechTrasPlastiCE project.
The quality plan will take three major elements, namely 1) quality committee project that establishes an overall governance of the quality aspect of the project, 2) internal and external communications and 3) external advisory committee.

These elements aim to provide sufficient mechanisms and instruments approved by mutual agreement to ensure compliance with the project's objectives and indicators with high-quality standards and delimiting decision-making elements. 
Also, it will specify the means of communication, frequency and the external advisory board that will join the project to guarantee the outputs of the project implementation.
